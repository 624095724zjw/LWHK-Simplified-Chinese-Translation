tc.research_category.THAUMIC_AUGMENTATION=神秘进阶
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumic_augmentation_base.title=神秘进阶
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumic_augmentation_base.0=我将把魔导手册的这一部分用于记载我的各种发现。谁知道我会有什么奇思妙想呢？

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.title=神秘法师护手
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.0=如我之前所注意到的那样，铁是不良的Vis导体。它仅能发挥导体的基本作用。但现在，既然我已经发现了神秘锭，那么升级旧的法师护手原型以使其比以往更加高效，应该是一个简单的任务。<BR>在我改进法师护手的时候，我不妨顺便研究一下魔力布匹作为皮革替代品的可行性。
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_thaumium.1=我已经成功制造出了新的法师护手，我（毫无创意地）将其称为“神秘法师护手”。神秘锭的引入使得Vis的利用率提高了10%，同时稍微减少了施法之间的冷却时间。<BR>魔力布匹似乎很容易上色——我只需要在工作台上将法师护手与一个或更多的染料混合在一起，就能获得一个具有崭新色彩的神秘法师护手。如果想要移除染料，只需对着一个装满水的普通炼药锅使用法师护手即可。

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.title=虚空预言者法师护手
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.0=我在制造神秘法师护手时取得了成功，这使我不禁想知道虚空金属是否如神秘锭一样，是种良好的Vis导体。即便它不是，我也很难相信它的形态特性毫无益处。
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.1=目前为止，我的研究结果意外地令人失望。我看到施法时消耗的Vis有所减少，但并不足以胜过神秘锭更快的充能速率。<BR>也许我尝试改进时所使用的部件是错误的......
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_void.2=看来我先前的猜想已经被证明是正确的。将魔力谐振器替换为虚空预言者的珍珠后，我能感觉到护手与周围灵气场的联系变得更加紧密。事实上，这联系无比紧密，使得如今的护手比起我的法师护手原型有了30%的Vis减免，还能吸收更大范围内的Vis。希望这意味着我能够在使用复杂的法术时，不像以前那样过于快速地耗尽周边的灵气。<BR>看起来这个护手虽然在冷却时间方面胜过了原来的法具，但神秘护手在这一点上仍然要更强一些。我不得不在更少的Vis消耗和更短的冷却时间之间做出选择，判断哪一个对我而言更有价值。幸运的是，虚空预言者法师护手仍然保持着其前身的染色能力。染料的使用和移除方法与神秘护手相同。

thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.title=灵气再生器
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.0=根据我过去的经验，一次高级奥术合成或复杂施法会使附近的灵气消耗殆尽。我应该试着寻找方法来帮助灵气场自我恢复，以使其比自然恢复速度更快。
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.1=我计划制造一种装置，我将其称为灵气再生器。它包含一个由银树树叶和源质滤管制成的栅格，以及一个试图通过栅格“再循环”灵气的外壳。<BR>这个设备有一个有趣的特点，其效能似乎与区域内灵气的总容量有关。换句话说，自然生成的Vis总含量低的区域会有更高的再生速度。<BR>如果我出于某种原因需要关闭灵气再生器的话，为它提供红石信号应该就能达到效果。
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_regenerator.2=鉴于灵气再生器和区域内灵气场间微妙的关系，我应该避免在充满咒波的区域使用它。我有种预感，它会让灵气场的污染更加严重......

thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.title=印记拓印器
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.0=对于小型的工程来说，手动配置操控印记是个不错的选择，但是一旦涉及到成堆的印记，这种方法就会变得乏味且容易出错。我应该研究一种用于快速配置大量的印记的方法。
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_copier.1=我计划制造一种基础的印记拓印装置。我只需要按我所需配置好一个印记，然后用印记拓印器右键单击它，即可复制该印记的设置。接下来我只需要右击其它要应用该设置的印记，便可以快速完成配置。如果我想清除拓印器所记忆的印记设置，我只需在潜行时右键单击，然后我便可以继续复制新的设置。<BR>看起来我的印记拓印器无法与其他人的印记进行交互。如果我要与其他神秘使合作，我应该牢记这一点。

thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.title=操控印记：治安
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.0=虽然我已经创造了能使傀儡保护特定区域的操控印记，但我感觉这不足以完整地发挥战斗傀儡的能力。事实上，使用守卫印记来让傀儡保护小范围区域是件微不足道的事情，真正具有挑战性的任务是驱使傀儡攻击它们所看见的任何怪物。
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.1=在简单的调整后，守卫印记已经变成了治安印记。这个印记会驱使有战斗能力的傀儡攻击它们所看到的处于执行区域内的任何威胁，而不是小范围内存在的威胁。与大多数其它的印记不同，治安印记的作用范围是不可调整的——治安印记会使附近的傀儡攻击任何侵入印记周围固定范围的生物（但作用范围要比一般的印记大得多）。然而，这意味着我应该格外小心，确保傀儡不会攻击任何不应该攻击的生物，因为此类意外事故会导致令人不快的后果。
thaumicaugmentation.research.seal_secure.2=我现在可以制造这个印记的高级版本。高级版本的印记使我能更好地控制拥有神秘生物学之心的傀儡，决定它们会攻击什么生物，以及它们是否应该只关注自己视线内的目标。

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.title=进一步的神秘学研究
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_auromancy.0=我已经发现了许多元素核心的效果，但我觉得还有更多值得探索的东西。考虑到我尚未对许多源质要素进行过试验，我肯定能从中找到一些有用的成果。

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.title=核心效果：光源
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.0=虽然火焰确实能发光，但它们有点......容易造成破坏。创造一种完全用于发光的核心效果应该是很简单的一件事。首先，我需要检验一下我能设法获得的光源。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_light.1=这种光的形式正是我所需要的——它能创造出明亮的光源，无论在任何地方使用都是如此。被创造出的光源甚至可以永远持续发光——这意味着如果我愿意的话，我能用它永久照明。<BR>我相当好奇一个生物暴露在这种形式的光的照射中会发生些什么。

thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.title=守护奥术
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.0=在浏览魔导手册中的一些旧手稿时，我偶然看到一部分内容描述了守护奥术的相关应用。创造某种物体，使其能抵挡所有外来的破坏，仅对其主人开放，这听起来像是我该研究的东西。我应该从已有的被守护的设备开始展开研究，比如说源质罐子（Warded Jar）。
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.1=我的检验表明，源质罐子提供了我所需要知道的一切——我只需对物体附加特殊的符文，然后基本上所有的材料都应该能获得这种保护性的特质。虽然我一想到其广阔的应用前景就感到兴奋，但我首先应该对一些简单的物品开始着手进行改造——比如说一个箱子。
thaumicaugmentation.research.warded_arcana.2=通过对普通的箱子附加守护印记后，我创造了一个特殊的容器，它不仅能够免受所有外来力量的破坏，还只能由我来使用。这意味着我无法通过传统的方式来导出或输入物品，比如漏斗和傀儡——这可能是我未来要深入研究的内容。<BR>如果我想要移走箱子的话，我需要潜行然后使用任意的法师护手右键点击它。

thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.title=奥能之扉
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.0=现在我已经掌握了守护奥术的基本知识，我觉得可以进一步研究更高级的东西了。先前我阅读的原稿描述了一种坚不可摧的门，这听起来像是某种值得研究的东西。毕竟时不时地要更换被僵尸破坏的门是一件令人苦恼的事情......
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_door.1=我设法制造了手稿中所描述的这种门，并将其称为奥能之扉。就像被守护的箱子一样，奥能之扉只能由其建造者开启，并且尝试使用一般方法移除它将极其困难。我还制作了三种不同类型的奥能之扉——宏伟之木奥能之扉，银树奥能之扉，以及神秘奥能之扉。它们的功能相同，但出于装饰用途，能够有所选择还是很不错的一件事。<BR>如果我想移除奥能之扉，我需要潜行然后对它的下半部分使用法师护手。<BR>看起来这种门在某种意义上来说非常“智能”，当两扇门放在一起时它们会同时开启或是关闭。相当方便。<BR>我还制造了奥能之扉的活板门形式。它们的工作方式与奥能之扉完全相同，只不过外形更小，且没有那么“智能”。

thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.title=访问权限
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.0=能够拥有私人物品是一件很美好的事，但有时候我需要和我的神秘使伙伴分享我的物品。我应该设计一种方法来选择性地授予访问权限。
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_keys.1=我已经制造了一种物品，可供他人随意访问被守护的物体（被守护的箱子，奥能之扉和奥术活板门）——那即是钥匙。但注意，这可不是普通的钥匙，因为它们能够记住与其绑定的人。这足以使其通过守护印记的保护，为被绑定人提供与其相匹配的物品的访问权限。每种钥匙的工作方式都略有不同——我把它们的使用说明写在接下来的几页，以备不时之需。<PAGE>铁钥匙<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_iron.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>铁钥匙是三种钥匙中最简单的一种。要将一个人与我的被守护物品绑定，我需要手持钥匙右击空气（不需要对任何方块使用）。然后，任何拥有钥匙的人都会获得访问被守护的箱子中物品的权限。要将钥匙解除绑定，我需要在潜行时使用钥匙。<PAGE>黄铜钥匙<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_brass.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>黄铜钥匙的功能与铁钥匙类似——使用时绑定，潜行时使用以解除绑定。然而，黄铜钥匙拥有更高的权限，能够将它的绑定信息复制到铁钥匙上。要做到这一点，需要把黄铜钥匙和未绑定的铁钥匙放在普通的工作台中进行合成。黄铜钥匙在这一过程中不会被消耗。复制神秘钥匙绑定信息的相关内容将在下一部分介绍。<PAGE>神秘钥匙<DIV><IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/items/key_thaumium.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG>神秘钥匙的有趣之处在于它不仅能绑定到生物——它还能与物体和其所在位置绑定。换言之，神秘钥匙允许绑定某位置的单个受保护的物体。要绑定神秘钥匙，我需要对被守护的物体使用它。即使把物体移动到了另一个位置，神秘钥匙的绑定依然有效，但前提是它与之前所绑定的对象是匹配的。和其它的钥匙一样，潜行时使用钥匙可以解除绑定。要复制一把绑定信息相同的神秘钥匙，我需要将已绑定的神秘钥匙和另一把未绑定的神秘钥匙以及绑定信息和神秘钥匙相同的一把黄铜钥匙放到普通的工作台中进行合成。好吧，我承认这有点麻烦......

thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.title=裂隙行者之靴
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.0=借助虚空金属，我可以升级我现有的大部分装备，以便利用虚空金属卓越的品质。不过对我来说，把这种材料用到旅行者之靴上才是最有意义的。
thaumicaugmentation.research.boots_void.1=我已经成功地将旅行者之靴升级成了更高级的形式，我称之为裂隙行者之靴。裂隙行者之靴的速度和跳跃高度加成比起原来的旅行者之靴都有了明显的提升（代价是略微增加的Vis消耗），同时也具有虚空金属制品的自我修复能力。最值得注意的是，穿着裂隙行者之靴后摔落伤害会大幅降低，远超这双靴子所能及的最大跳跃高度所能造成的伤害——我几乎可以纵身跃入沟壑之中，然后毫发无伤地离开。<BR>裂隙行者之靴也可以被染色。我只需要将其与染料合成即可获得不同颜色的靴子，也可以使用装满水的普通炼药锅洗去颜色。

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.title=裂隙研究
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.0=我认为咒波裂隙对我的研究比表面上看起来要重要得多。当裂隙因过量的咒波而创生之际，它们连接虚空并打开了虚空之门。我确信它们包含着某种秘密，用以打开前往新领域的裂隙，而那些新领域比起这个世界，或许更加......充满热情。<BR>然而，目前研究咒波裂隙需要我将咒波充满灵气场。如果将所有咒波储存到一个小巧的“种子”之中，然后将其释放到目标区域，比起选择其它各类会导致麻烦的方式或许会好得多。我应该研究将大量咒波压缩进狭小空间中的方法。
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_studies.1=通过将大量的Vitium源质集中到一个虚空种子之中，其产生的咒波不久就会被吸收到灵气场之内，几乎肯定能产生一个裂隙。我应该非常小心地对待这些咒波种子——“种植”它们会瞬间释放其中所储存的咒波，同时消耗掉种子。<BR>看起来将种子中的源质种类严格限制为只有Vitium时，每单位的源质能产生更多的咒波，比起将它们随意地倾泻到灵气场中要高效得多。如果我想利用这种现象来制造更大的裂隙，那么我应该将更多的Vitium源质注入更小的咒波种子中。然而，随着Vitium源质量的增加，注魔风险也会上升，并且出于安全起见，我似乎仅能对给定的咒波种子使用一次注魔。

thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.title=增强学
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.0=虽然制造出像神秘护手一样的升级版法师护手是一件了不起的事，但目前我还无法想出关于新护手的设计。也许我应该花点时间考虑一下尝试改进现有设计的方法。这也为我提供了一个机会，我得以开始思考能否构建一个模块化程度足够高的系统用于升级护手，以便我在取得新的研究进展时无需频繁地更换法师护手。
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.1=我已经想到了一些初步的方案，以建立一个使施术核心更加高效的系统。所需的第一个组件是一种“调整器”，用于为施法者提供额外的能量。然而，我需要某种过滤装置来实际利用这些额外的能量——我想我可以用类似制造核心的方法来制造它。由于这些物品是法师护手既存机制的附加品，我确信我应该把它们叫做“增强器”。<BR>虽然我想应用各种调整器来作为这些增效水晶的能量提供者，但我应该从一些简单的东西开始。到目前为止，我所制造的法师护手都是借助魔力谐振器与灵气场相连接。也许我能制造一种谐振器专门针对某种特定的源质要素发挥作用，而非与整个谱系中的要素都发生共振。<BR>这种新的元素谐振器调整器应该能使护手更高效地利用源质中的单个要素，使得与其使用相同要素的施术核心能更有效地发挥作用。根据我所决定使用的核心水晶，以下三种特性的其中之一会受到影响：核心能量、施法速度或Vis效能。然而，由于这种方法“放大”了要素的能力，所以这一处理方式只可能为每个法师护手提供一种要素的加成。但我仍然为此感到振奋，因为我建立了模块化的增强体系，并亲眼见证了我所发明的全新的增强系统在付诸实践时是何其有效。<BR>为了实际建造这种增强装置，我需要合成一个元素谐振器（工作方式与调整器相同）并将其与任意增效水晶在工作台中合成。遗憾的是，一旦组合完成，就无法重新把它们分开了。虽然在我草拟的计划中，我使用了Ordo水晶和核心能量增效水晶作为例子，但我应该能够使用任意魔法水晶和增效水晶的组合，其种类取决于我想让哪种要素和特性变得更加强力。
thaumicaugmentation.research.gauntlet_augmentation.2=正如我所想的那样，我已经能够分毫不差地制造出最终的谐振器成品。然而我在施法时遇上了未曾预料的问题，虽然单个要素会效果更强，但一种或多种其它要素的效用却会因谐振器的存在而受到负面影响。在使用不同要素的元素谐振器时，受影响的要素似乎各不相同。我应该测试我打算使用的各种要素，以确保我想使用的核心不会受到负面影响。<BR>我能将元素调整器（或是任意完整的将其作为调整器的增强器）和任意魔力水晶放置在工作台中合成以替换其内含的水晶。我也可以借此取回旧的水晶。<BR>至于增强系统本身，我已经将其设计的相当模块化。如我之前所记录的那样，每种增强器都由一个调整器（如元素调整器）和一个增效水晶（三种核心水晶的其中之一：核心能量，施法速度，Vis消耗）组成，在普通的工作台中组合并合成即可获得。为了将增强器应用于一个装置，我只需要将它和需要增强的物品（目前主要是我的法师护手）通过任意一种合成格位来合成。虽然看起来这些法师护手应该可以支持至少3个增强器而不出问题，但将多个使用相同类型的调整器的增强器（要素类型不同的元素谐振器也被视为相同类型的调整器）也是不可能的。如果我出于某种原因要移除一个增强器，将护手单独放到合成格位中分解即可移除最后添加的一个增强器。这使得无限次地移除和添加增强器成为可能。<BR>遗憾的是，我无法让最初的法师护手支持我的增强系统。它所使用的材料看起来过于脆弱，无法承受增强器所带来的额外压力。算了，反正它只是个原型而已。

thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.title=维度调整器
thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.0=我已经制造了元素调整器，它可以通过对核心要素的内在刺激产生反应来增强施法效果。与此同时，我设想应该也能够使用某些物品来制作对外来刺激产生反应的调整器。其中最简单的就是构成我所能访问的维度的普通材料。我应该研究各维度的一些材料样本，看看我能否使用它们来达成这个目的，并且找到一种方法制作新的调整器，使得我身处该调整器的材料所来源的维度时，核心施术效果能有所增强。
thaumicaugmentation.research.dimensional_modifiers.1=我已经制造了三种不同的维度调整器，它们分别在主世界、下界和末地会对外界刺激积极地发生反应。维度调整器本身的工作原理是使用了一种晶体结构，它在处于制成晶体的材料所来源的维度时，就会与维度建立连接并发生共振。在所有维度调整器都能带来助益的同时，下界调整器的增益效果似乎比主世界调整器的更强，而末地调整器的增益效果更是强过这二者。我不太清楚为什么会有这种情况，尤其是考虑到下界和末地的Vis水平通常比主世界要低，按理来说情况应该相反才对。不过我也许可以在未来的进一步研究中找到答案。或许还有别的因素在其中发挥作用。

thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.title=调整器：虚域
thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.0=现在我已经探访了虚域，我应该可以制造一种维度调整器，使得核心施法在那里能够更加有效，就像我到目前已经制造的三种相对平常的维度所对应的维度调整器一样。
thaumicaugmentation.research.emptiness_modifier.1=有了制造之前的维度调整器的经验，为虚域再制造一个调整器是个简单的任务。我只需要直接应用先前的维度调整器制造原则，而非再次耗费虚域特有的资源来进行研究。这种调整器看起来和末地的调整器一样强大，这确实是个意外之喜。我现在的确发现了一个奇怪的巧合，即一个维度越接近虚无，其相关联的维度调整器就越强大，比如说末地和虚域这两个维度，里面几乎只有繁星闪烁的虚无中漂浮的荒芜孤岛。事实上，这可能根本就不是巧合。我担心这些维度中的邪术能量（以这些世界的材料中Alienis，Vacuos和Tenebrae要素的数量呈现）会对灵气场产生影响。我也不确定这可能导致的长期后果，但几乎可以肯定的是我日后必须对此多加关注。

thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.title=调整器：增流
thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.0=我在研究和试验调整器方面的大多数努力都集中在了被动效果上。尝试想出某种体系来在我使用法术时主动地增加我的施法能力，或许是精明之举。<BR>一般来说，Vis在法师护手中的流动必须被调整到较低速率，否则装置可能因过载而无法正常工作。但如果我使用Vis足够频繁的话，应该就可以缓慢地提高法师护手中的流量上限。这么做主要的问题是，要精确地监控Vis用量的细微差异并非什么容易的事，对于我现在可以使用的装备而言尤其如此。但假如有其它方法可以间接检测我的Vis用量呢？<BR>我已经想到了一种或许会起效的方法——在我最近对傀儡学的研究中，我制造出了一种攻击组件，用于驱使傀儡攻击其它的生物。如果我能以某种方式检测我在通过核心施法伤害某物时攻击组件中的反应，我也许可以使用它作为加速护手中Vis流动的提示信号。我应该将理论付诸实践，但我不知道这能否如我所希望的那样运作。
thaumicaugmentation.research.frenzy_modifier.1=令人惊喜的是，利用攻击组件调控Vis流量的设想取得了成功。攻击组件在经过微小调整后就可以探测核心施术时对生物造成的伤害，并且会据此输出可测量的信号。增流调整器——我打算这么称呼它——可以逐渐地提升法师护手和其安装的核心中的Vis流量。简单来说，如果我在相对短的时间内连续对怪物或其它生物造成伤害，我的施法就会逐渐变得越来越强。如果我收起法师护手，或是在一定时间内没有使用它对任何生物造成伤害，Vis的流量将会立刻重置为自然水平。

thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.title=调整器：求知
thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.0=虽然我已经能够借助求知发带之类的物品来利用经验球中的知识，但我觉得我也许能利用经验球中所含的知识来更好地汇聚施法时所涉及的魔法能量。知识与神秘学有本质上的联系，正如充满智慧的神秘使能更好地操纵灵气场，因为他们对灵气流动的了解更为全面和深入，对操纵灵气的方式有更深层次的理解。通过研究经验和等级，我或许能找到提升施法能力的其它方法。
thaumicaugmentation.research.experience_modifier.1=通过研究获得的关于灵气场的知识会自然地提升一个人使用灵气的能力。所以唯一合乎逻辑的解释即是日常生活中所获得的经验，无论是一般活动还是更加深奥的实践行为，都能够强化一个人的神秘学能力。基于这种观点，我设法制造了一个可用于装配增强器的调整器，用于根据我获得的经验等级来提高对Vis流的操控水平。即便是很少的经验，我也应该能看到明显的增益效果。我需要相当多的经验来充分利用这个调整器的能力——我料想智慧不会轻易地把自己被借给没有经验的人。

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.title=虚空石
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.0=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>虚空石这种深色的石头可以在维度裂缝的周围找到。它很容易与自身的其它部分结合，这意味着它会在遭到破坏后会重新组合到一起。它也明显比普通的石头要软得多。
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.1=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone_soil_taint_side_0.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>我将新发现的这种方块称为腐化虚空石壤。这层腐化物出现在虚空中腐化区域的表面。尽管它仍可以相对容易地粘在一起，但有所不同的是它似乎被注入了某种古老的生物材料——与我过去遭遇过的腐化物很相似。与“正常”的腐化方块不同，它非常稳定，不会随时间推移而扩散或消亡。
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone.2=<IMG>thaumicaugmentation:textures/blocks/void_stone_taint.png:0:0:255:255:0.125</IMG><BR>我将这种虚空石的变种称为腐化虚空石。可以在虚空的腐化之地中找到。如它所对应的土壤一样，它不会消亡或是蔓延到附近的材料上。

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.title=量产邪术石
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.0=有一件事我尚未确认，那就是在血腥仪式中提及的一种特殊类型的石头——一种极其坚固并且具有与奥术石有相似魔法性质的石头。虽然缺少关于其制造方法的细节，但血腥仪式中提到了要将紫色的石头和邪术能量混合在一起。这种紫色的石头听起来和我最近发现的虚空石十分相似——我需要亲自调查一番。
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_stone_usage.1=虽然不知是好事还是坏事，血型教徒们又一次说对了。我能够将小块虚空石变成他们所描述的石头，我将其称为邪术石。正如仪式中所述的那样，这种石头能够承受几乎任何爆炸，并且用镐或其它工具采集它也需要花费更多的时间。

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.title=裂隙能量
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.0=从裂隙中汲取能量来制造虚空种子是很有用的，但我觉得我仅仅触及了裂隙能量所蕴含的潜能的表面。然而，在我能够找到这种能量的用途之前，我需要先找到将它导出为可用形式的方法。
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.1=多亏了之前进行的一些研究，我已经确定，在一个特制的存储单元中保存来自裂隙的能量是可行的。这个能量单元需要一个经过重大改造的虚空种子作为核心，用于充当能量的接收器。<BR>我想我应该给这种能量起个名字。由于裂隙能量似乎比我之前使用的Vis要不稳定得多，我认为合适的名字应该是“元动”——意味着动能和力量。<BR>现在我所需的只是一个能够提取能量的工具。我确信我能直接使用自己研发的增强系统来将某种能量提取器附加到法师护手上，而非制造专门的工具来达成这一目的。
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_power.2=我终于完成了钻研元动能量所需的全部制品。我所制造的装置不仅能从裂隙中提取能量，还可以较为迅速地将其释放。为了开始研究，我应该将元动能量电池安装到法师护手上。然后，我只需要站在咒波裂隙附近，它便会缓慢地将裂隙中的能量汲取到增强器中。<BR>就像虚空吸管一样，从裂隙中吸取能量会导致裂隙变得不稳定，然后开始收缩——最终归于虚无。如果我不想被迫持续制造新的咒波裂隙，我应该确保裂隙保持稳定并且有一个合适的尺寸。<BR>虽然我暂时没有其他的装置来使用元动能量，但我注意到元动能量对法师护手本身具有奇特的效果。元动能量的存在似乎会略微地增加任何核心的能量，而在这一过程中元动能量本身并不会被消耗。看起来，只要法师护手所安装的元动能量电池中储存有一些元动能量，这一现象就会持续发生——元动能量的含量似乎并不重要。

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.title=核心效果：守护
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.0=如今我已成功地保护了个人物品，我想我应该研究一下如何将守护秘术应用于这个世界的任意材料。虽然我怀疑对任意给定的材料施加守护奥术并不能够达到被守护的箱子那样的强度，但任何额外的保护措施都值得研究一番。我应该试验一些常见的破坏手段，看看我能做到哪种程度。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.1=令人惊喜的是，我的试验结果比我预期的要好——我已经研制出了一种核心效果，能够保护这个世界中所放置的任何简单材料。所谓的“简单材料”包括像石头和泥土这种惰性的、无特殊性质的物体。遗憾的是，被守护的机器将在时间上被冻结，这意味着像红石机器这样的物体被保护后将无法正常工作。更复杂的机器则完全无法被保护。<BR>虽然我已经尽己所能来抵御不同种类的破坏，但我知道我无法保护物体免受所有类型的破坏。尽管如此，我确信被守护的方块应该能免疫挖掘破坏、普通爆炸、火焰伤害、活塞推动，甚至能让沙子和砂砾不受重力的影响。<BR>有非常多的方法来获知某物是否被这种核心效果所保护——最简单的方法就是尝试挖掘它。如果被挖掘的方块上出现了能量的波纹，那么它显然是受保护的。手持任意装备了守护核心的法师护手可以使我直接观察到方块周围的守护能量，在我所看向的小范围区域内被守护的方块会被给予闪光效果。闪光效果的颜色似乎和施法者有关——如果施法者是我本人，颗粒效果看起来是绿色的，如果施法者不是我，那么颗粒就是红色的。<BR>要移除一个方块上的守护奥术，我只需要重新对它使用守护核心即可。如果一个被保护的方块遭到破坏，那么守护效果也会在其所在位置消失。<BR>最后，我应该格外小心地选择要保护的对象。虽然尝试给不同对象施加守护法术会是非常有趣的一件事，但我所涉足的还是神秘术中的陌生领域。我无法保证这种法术在任何方块上都能完美运作。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.2=傀儡在工作时似乎会忽视被守护物体的存在。如果我发现我的傀儡在漫无目的地四处游荡，而非执行它们的任务，那么我应该确保它们所要与之互动的方块没有被保护。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.3=奥术钻探机看起来在面对被保护方块时足够智能，它会直接忽略掉被保护方块并采掘它所能挖掘的方块。然而，被守护的方块会阻止奥术钻探机采掘被保护方块背后的方块。如果我希望使用奥术钻探机，那么我应该确保采掘区域没有被保护的方块。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.4=裂隙核心效果应该不会对任何被保护方块起作用。这意味着我应该能够设立一个禁区，使得附近的其他神秘使即便发现了这种维度魔法也无法入内。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_coremod.5=我已经确认更替核心效果无法在被保护的方块上发挥作用。任何更替被保护方块的尝试都会完全失败，就像尝试替换不可破坏的方块一样。这样一来，即便附近有其他的神秘术研习者，我的被保护区域仍然是安全的。

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.title=核心效果：守护
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.0=如今我已成功地保护了个人物品，我想我应该研究一下将守护秘术应用于这个世界的任意材料。虽然我怀疑对任意给定的材料施加守护奥术是否能够达到被守护的箱子那样的强度，但任何额外的保护措施都值得研究一番。我应该试验一些常见的破坏手段，看看我能做到哪种程度。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.1=令人惊喜的是，我的试验结果比我预期的要好——我已经研制出了一种核心效果，能够保护这个世界中所放置的任何简单材料。所谓的“简单材料”包括像石头和泥土这种惰性的、无特殊性质的物体。遗憾的是，被守护的机器将在时间上被冻结，这意味着像红石机器这样的物体被保护后将无法正常工作。更复杂的机器则完全无法被保护。<BR>虽然我已经尽己所能来抵御不同种类的破坏，但我知道我无法保护物体免受所有类型的破坏。尽管如此，我确信被守护的方块应该能免疫挖掘破坏、普通爆炸、火焰伤害、活塞推动，甚至能让沙子和砂砾不受重力的影响。<BR>有非常多的方法来获知某物是否被这种核心效果所保护——最简单的方法就是尝试挖掘它。如果被挖掘的方块上出现了能量的波纹，那么它显然是受保护的。手持任意装备了守护核心的法师护手可以使我直接观察到方块周围的守护能量，在我所看向的小范围区域内被守护的方块会被给予闪光效果。闪光效果的颜色似乎和施法者有关——如果施法者是我本人，颗粒效果看起来是绿色的，如果施法者不是我，那么颗粒就是红色的。<BR>要移除一个方块上的守护奥术，我只需要重新对它使用守护核心即可。如果一个被保护的方块遭到破坏，那么守护效果也会在其所在位置消失。<BR>最后，我应该格外小心地选择要保护的对象。虽然尝试给不同对象施加守护法术会是非常有趣的一件事，但我所涉足的还是神秘术中的陌生领域。我无法保证这种法术在任何方块上都能完美运作。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.2=傀儡在工作时似乎会忽视被守护物体的存在。如果我发现我的傀儡在漫无目的地四处游荡，而非执行它们的任务，那么我应该确保它们所要与之互动的方块没有被保护。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.3=看起来奥术钻探机的线性机械运作方式被得到保护的方块给困住了。如果下一个要挖掘的方块是被保护的，奥术钻探机将会一直挖掘它，永不停息地进行失败的尝试。如果我想使用奥术钻探机的话，我应该确保挖掘区域内没有被保护的方块。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.4=由于裂隙核心效果会让方块移动到其他的地方，所以那些裂隙也将会在被保护的方块上产生。如果我尝试建立一个禁区，或是我周围有其他的神秘使，那么我应该牢记这一点。
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_ward_no_coremod.5=由于更替核心效果只是用一种方块替换某个位置上的其他方块，所以被保护的方块也能够被替换。然而，保护效果会停留在新替换的方块上。但如果附近有其他的神秘术研习者，我仍应该小心一点。

thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.title=发现虚域
thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.0=我一直试图确定是否有可能开启相对安全的咒波裂隙，能让我进入其中并且不会因此迅速死亡。虽然我认为自己不太可能打开一个，但我有一个新理论，即这种裂隙也许自然存在于这个世界。然而，这些现实结构之中的裂缝只能出现在特定的位置，这些地方的维度间屏障比平常的要更加薄弱。我应该制造一种能帮助我定位它们的装置。
thaumicaugmentation.research.fracture_theory.1=我计划制作一种新的装置，这种装置应该能引领我找到维度裂缝。通过将Vacuos魔力水晶和一些稀土混合，水晶能对外界的同类要素发生强烈的反应——而Vacuos恰恰是虚空之中所产生的要素。我还需要使用如黄铜一样的普通材料制成外壳，因为使用神秘锭或虚空金属或许会导致装置反应过于灵敏，以致无法获得准确的读数。<BR>一旦合成完毕，如果我面向裂缝，装置中的水晶将会发光。光的亮度越高，就说明我越接近正确的方向。遗憾的是，裂缝定位器的探测范围看起来有限的。我无法给出定位器探测半径的准确数据，但一些快速测试表明，其Vacuos要素探测能力在一定范围外会急剧下降，这个范围的半径大致是视野中地平线与地面相交的距离。<BR>我的计算似乎表明这些裂缝所导向的空间被大幅压缩了，就如同下界一样。或许当我在主世界寻找裂缝出现困难时，我应该去下界查看一下。

thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.title=踏入虚域
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.0=现在我完全确定维度裂缝是存在的，并且会通向某个地方。我应该寻找并扫描其中的一个裂缝以确定我的下一步行动计划。
research.m_DIMENSIONALFRACTURE.text=寻找维度裂缝
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.1=我先前提出的关于维度裂缝自然存在的理论已经得到了证实。虽然这已经是踏入裂缝彼端虚域的关键一步，但还有一个小问题有待解决。裂缝没有完全连接到另一端。幸运的是，一场能量的爆发应该足以将裂缝撕开，使其与另一个世界充分连接——而我如今已经有能力用元动能量来达成这一条件。<BR>我所需要的只是在一个裂缝上使用已安装元动能量电池并充能完毕的法师护手，随后等待一段时间，裂缝应该就会完全开启。我不知道另一端的世界里有什么，不过维度裂缝附近的地面也许已经给了我一些提示。尽管可能存在危险，但现在回头对我来说为时已晚。
research.m_ENTERVOID.text=探寻彼端所存
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.2=虽然我由衷地希望这个世界除了一望无际的黑暗荒原之外，能有一些更有趣的事物（显然事实并未如我所愿），但我仍然认为这片空间对我来说是很有用的。这里有大量紧密相邻的裂缝——它们所通往的区域应该彼此相距甚远，因为我在主世界甚至只是寻找一个裂缝都相当不易。除此之外，似乎许多不同的维度都通过裂缝连接此处。我也许可以看看能否利用这些裂缝来实现远距离旅行。<BR>如果以后我想打开更多的裂缝，我只需要重复我第一次到达这里时所做的事情——使用一个安装了（充能的）元动能量电池的法师护手对维度裂缝释放元动能量，然后等待数秒，直至裂缝生成。<BR>虽然这里的大多数地方看起来异常的安静，但我能看到腐化地区充满了生物。我在穿过腐化地区时应该格外小心，因为腐化生物是极度危险的。
thaumicaugmentation.research.entering_fracture.3=由于邪术守卫的任务是守护维度间屏障最为薄弱的地方，所以我有一种预感，他们恐怕不喜欢我打开维度裂缝的举动。我应该做好万全准备，以便在打开裂缝时对付这些不速之客。

thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.title=变形工具
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.0=当我持续在神秘术的世界之中大胆创新之际，我发现自己制造出的装备愈发精良。与此同时，尽管我的旧装备可能在效能上不如新的发明，但我可能觉得它们的外观更适合我的个人品味。我不应该在效能和虚荣心间做出妥协——我应该尝试寻找某种方法来制造一种工具，这种工具可以具有我所喜爱的物品的外观，但同时却有另一种物品的一般属性和魔法属性。为了达到这个目的，我也许可以对元始杵的玄异性质进行更加充分的研究。
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_tool.1=我发明了一种能有效地将两件物品组合到同一空间的方法。借助一颗元始珍珠和少量的Vacuos源质，我可以让两件物品存在于同一空间，但其中只有一个物品对外界观察者而言是可见的。另一件物品则为这个变形工具提供属性，例如攻击力和耐久度。在这种状态下，用于装饰的物品会保持某种虚无缥缈的状态，这意味着它不会损坏，同时无法通过任何方式与这个世界相互作用。<BR>要制造这种工具，我需要使用奥术注魔，把我想保持原有性质的物品放在中央，把装饰用途的物品放在外围的基座上（当然还需要其它必备物品）。如果我想分离这两件物品，我只需要把工具放到奥术工作台中分解——似乎分开它们所需的能量比起将它们合在一起所需的能量要少得多。<BR>如我之前所提到的，功能性的物品在通过玄异方式与装饰性物品绑定后依然有损坏的风险。而它处于混合状态时，无法通过传统的方法进行修复。不过，像虚空金属这样的材料仍然可以保持它们的再生性质。我也确信更加复杂的物品在变形工具中将会无法正常工作——虽然基本的工具即使附上了常规和注魔所得的魔咒，看起来依然表现正常，但像盔甲之类的物品却无法正常发挥作用。<BR>最后，变形工具似乎提供了轻微的绝缘效果，可以抵挡功能性物品所造成的扭曲。或许我将来应该重新审视这一现象，以确定我是否可以使其更加有效。

thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_armor.title=变形盔甲
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_armor.0=The Morphic Tool I previously created was a great success. Not only was it a breakthrough in applying the morphic properties of Primordial Pearls and Vacuos, but it also gave a purpose to my old, inferior equipment. Despite this advancement, there is still one major category of items I have not been able to use this process for - armour. I remember noting that it was too complex to keep multiple pieces of armour within the same space, without having one or both of them be disintegrated by the interdimensional forces holding them together, which I would rather not experience from the perspective of one wearing the armour. However, if I tighten the assumptions of what items are combined, then I might just be able to keep it stable enough. Making armour look like a sword is too much for it to handle, but what about two pieces of armour?
thaumicaugmentation.research.morphic_armor.1=I will admit, I am somewhat surprised at my success. I knew that reducing the disparities between the states the morphic item takes would make it more stable, but I underestimated how much of a difference it actually makes. I feel as if I can say that this new Morphic Armour will allow me to safely have a set of armour be displayed to the world, while in reality wearing a different set.<BR>The process for creating Morphic Armour is very similar to that of the Morphic Tool. The central item in the infusion is the piece of armour I want to keep the properties of, while the wearable item on the outside will become the outward appearance. Beyond than this, however, there a few key differences. The infusion also takes much more Vacuos, due to needing to control a larger space (hopefully without it collapsing in on me). This also makes the infusion much more unstable.<BR>Of course, I had to make some concessions to have this work at all. While the outward appearance of any given set of Morphic Armour will work largely as designed, a few physical properties from the functional armour 'leak' into it. Unlike the Morphic Tool, I will still be able to enchant and repair the armour in its morphic state, which will be applied as normal to the functional armour. This also means that should the armour break, I will lose the decorative portion as well. I should keep a watchful eye on its durability to ensure I don't lose more items than I need to. The process of separating the items from each other, via placing the armour in an empty crafting grid, still works with the Morphic Armour. This may be a good last resort, should my armour about to break.<BR>Lastly, the warp-insulating effect of the Morphic Tool has not carried over into the Morphic Armour. This is unfortunate, given that some armour sets can contribute a considerable amount of warp, but given the propagation of other physical properties from the functional armour, this is not a huge surprise.

thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.title=元始刃
thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.0=元始杵已经被证明是一种非常好用的工具，毕竟它本质上相当于四种工具的集合。令人遗憾的是，元始杵本身在特定方面依然有其局限性。具体来说，由于它十分笨重，且在挥舞时举起它需要花费不少时间，所以它并不适合作为武器使用。然而对我来说，将其形态不稳定性的原理用于制作不同的一套工具应该是可行的......比如说，一套切割用具？
thaumicaugmentation.research.primal_cutter.1=我的理论是正确的，并且我据此准备制造一件新武器：元始刃。如它的前身一样，它事实上是四种形态不稳定的工具的集合，它们之间的波动太过迅速，以致整体看起来就像是一件工具。<BR>这种工具和元始杵的主要区别是它的结构中使用的工具种类不同，确切来说，元始刃更像是斧和剑的结合体。它比元始杵更轻，因此我能够迅速地挥舞它，这让我能够用强力的切割攻击撕碎我的敌人。<BR>这件武器不仅保留了风雷剑的弧光魔咒和奔流斧的收集魔咒，还有两个额外的独特能力。两者中比较简单的是强大的削弱能力——比虚空剑还要强。元始刃所获得的另一个更加有趣的能力，则是在长按右键连续使用该武器时会将物品和生物向我拉近。在我能想到这个新能力的多种用途的同时，我必须小心——被拖动的实体能快速向我靠近，而且在使用该能力时武器会消耗额外的耐久。<BR>通过将这件武器放入合成格位中操作，可以开关这项能力。当我想在副手使用其他的工具或物品时，这也许会派上用场。<BR>尽管两者功能迥异，元始刃仍然与元始杵有一些相同的性质。除了像所有的虚空金属材料一样可以不断地再生之外，元始刃也具备了元始杵那不安的天性。当被拿在手中一段时间后，它会因虚空金属那微不可察的形状变换而微微颤抖。不过这并不妨碍我使用它，因为它是如此趁手的一件武器，令人难忘。<BR>而且我绝不会忘记它。

thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.title=Personal Flight
thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.0=To freely soar through the skies is something many wish they could do, and while it is technically possible for anyone to fly directly downward after jumping off a cliff, it might be a better idea to be able to fly in the other five directions as well. I do appreciate having intact legs, after all.<BR>While I have not made much progress in utilising Thaumaturgy to induce flight in any mobile form, there are still some things I can do in the meantime. I know I will need a wearable item to attach the flying mechanisms to, unless I want my hypothetical creation to shoot off into the stratosphere without me.
thaumicaugmentation.research.harness_base.1=I have designed a simple and relatively comfortable harness, with many buckles, straps, and connectors specifically aimed to allow the attachment of different arcane mechanisms and components. There is no point in wearing it in its current form, however, as it is simply a blank canvas for any flying devices to be built upon.<BR>With some further research, I can only imagine what different means of flight may be possible. I should take caution however, lest I become a faintly Thaumaturge-shaped crater at the bottom of a valley somewhere.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.title=Thaumostatic Harness
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.0=My recent invention of the Arcane Levitator has provided me with a very limited type of levitation-based flight, but ever since I completed that design I have wondered whether it would be possible to apply similar principles to a portable device that allows me to freely levitate wherever I desire. Some surface-level examination has revealed that this should be possible, but not simple.<BR>I will need to study levitation further, and ways to channel Vis appropriately to produce a stable levitating force. This might require me to study some fairly obscure sources of flight firsthand, so I should take steps to ensure my research will not be abruptly ended by an unexpected fall.
research.m_LEVITATE.text=Be lifted into the air by an external force.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_harness.1=The secrets of true levitation-based flight have been revealed to me, and I have now finalised my design for what I am calling the Thaumostatic Harness.<BR>The device operates by using stored Vis to anchor itself to the Aural Field, essentially hooking onto the ambient field the Aura creates. This will allow me to defy gravity for as long as the device has Vis. I must also continue wearing it, of course.<BR>To use the harness, I simply need to change it with Vis, equip it as a chest bauble and jump twice while in the air. To deactivate it, I can either land on solid ground or double jump again. With the amount of Vis the device can store, I should be able to fly continuously for a few minutes. However, while the Thaumostatic Harness is active, I will be unable to refill the Vis buffer. This means I will need to either land or unequip the harness for Vis-restoring items to work properly.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.title=Thaumostatic Gyroscope
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.0=Thaumostatic flight is somewhat prone to drifting. I do not come to an immediate halt when I stop moving, which while not a major issue can be annoying at times when precision is required.<BR>It should not be too difficult for me to design an upgrade that will make flight a little more stable, probably with some additional regulators in charge of controlling movement.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_gyroscope.1=This new augmentation for the Thaumostatic Harness stabilizes flight greatly, preventing drift when I stop moving. These gyroscopic stabilizers carefully regulate the velocity output of the harness, ensuring that I can always come to a quick halt. Like all other augments, this upgrade can be combined with a Thaumostatic Harness by placing the harness and gyroscopes in a crafting grid, while placing an augmented harness alone in a crafting grid will remove the augment.<BR>Unfortunately, stabilized flight comes with a few downsides. The increased regulation required to allow stopping quickly also limits the maximum speed achievable with the harness, but this may not be so debilitating for precise tasks like building. I have also been forced to slightly reduce the size of the integrated Vis buffer by about 25%. However, the fact that the harness now moves more slowly should also lead to decreased Vis usage, so this may not be a problem in practice.

thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.title=Thaumostatic Girdle
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.0=While Thaumostatic flight is already an excellent mode of transportation, the speed of flight it provides is quite limited. I may be able to make some further adjustments to maximise the velocity output of the harness. Finding the right balance between speed and Vis cost may be a bit of a challenge, however.
thaumicaugmentation.research.thaumostatic_girdle.1=As expected, I have been successful in creating an upgrade for the Thaumostatic Harness that raises the maximum speed I can fly at, without compromising too much in other areas. This Thaumostatic Girdle is an additional belt that allows the harness to draw more Vis from its internal buffer at once to facilitate faster speeds. It can be attached to the harness by combining them together in a crafting grid, while placing the augmented harness alone in the grid will remove the girdle.<BR>In addition to the aforementioned increased Vis cost, the Thaumostatic Girdle makes flight much less stable, meaning I need to be careful with the large amount of drift that can occur when I stop moving. On a more positive note, I was able to increase the size of the Vis buffer by 25% and allow the harness to support sprinting while flying for even faster speeds. Using this sprint ability comes at no additional Vis cost.

thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.title=Elytra Harness
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.0=In my multidimensional travels I have happened across a truly fascinating object: a pair of insectoid gliding wings. While a great deal of their origins are shrouded in mystery, I do know that these wings come from hovering ships docked at the abandoned cities in the outer islands of The End. Clearly some long-deceased race of beings once created these cities and used these wings, though whether their origins were mundane or magical is unclear to me. It makes me wonder what their relation was to the abandoned structures littering The End: were they used by scouts to protect trade ships? Wage wars with mighty floating vessels against rival cities? While I do not think I will be unlocking any major secrets about the structures, at least I have these wings to examine.<BR>This elytra is unique in that instead of offering direct flight, it provides a surprisingly versatile means of gliding, enabling me to attain impressive speeds of I dare to push the limits of both the wings and my bravery.<BR>However, the elytra do have a few shortcomings. First and foremost, I cannot wear them at the same time as any other chestplate or robe. They also suffer from degradation quite quickly while in use, requiring almost constant maintenance. After I become accustomed to the style of gliding these wings provide, I should be able to apply some Thaumaturgical principles to solve both of these issues.
research.m_ELYTRAFLY.text=Gain some experience flying with elytra.
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_harness.1=I have managed to create a successful design for an upgrade to the elytra. The flight harness I previously designed acts as the base for these upgrades, and allowed me to make quite a few improvements.<BR>Firstly, the Elytra Harness can be worn as a chest bauble, meaning I no longer have to choose between armour and gliding. Despite relocating the elytra to this area, its mode of operation is still the same: jump while falling to begin gliding.<BR>Second, I have done a great deal to mitigate the poor durability of the original elytra. My first modification was adding a light void metal weave throughout the wings. While they are still burdened by durability, this allows the wings to slowly repair themselves when not in use. Furthermore, I have also applied a protective ward that allows Vis to be consumed instead of damaging the wings. This protective shield only contains 50 points of Vis, and cannot be regenerated while in the air, but it can prevent any durability from being lost on shorter flights.<BR>Even with all of my improvements, it is still possible for the elytra to break mid-flight in extreme situations. I should carefully monitor their condition to ensure I do not suddenly drop out of the sky. Thankfully, in the event this does occur, the elytra will still be functional after they are given time to repair themselves.<BR>Lastly, I took the opportunity to allow the Elytra Harness to have a bit of a personal touch. I am able to apply any kind of banner to replace the appearance of the wings with that of the banner. This applies to mundane banners, which will apply their colour and patterns to the elytra, but also for Thaumaturgic banners, which will apply their colour and aspect insignia. For added flair, the color of the banner will also be applied to the sparkling trail that appears as I fly.<BR>Other cosmetic items may work as an upgrade as well - there is no harm in trying to see if it does indeed work.<BR>To apply a banner or other upgrade, I just need to place it and the harness in a crafting grid. Removing the upgrade is as simple as placing the harness by itself in a crafting grid.

thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.title=Elytra Boosting
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.0=Despite how effective elytra gliding can be, there is one major problem with it: it is not true flight. It requires finding a high enough point to fall from to gain a decent amount of momentum; if I am in a flat area, I am out of luck. I suppose I could use a mundane contraption with pistons and slime blocks, but that requires setup ahead of time and is not a mobile solution.<BR>I do have some inspiration to work off of, in the form of fireworks. If I am gliding and set off an ordinary firework, it will boost me a fair distance. This method is not particularly good, however. It requires large amounts of gunpowder to be sustainable, and I can only carry so many of them. Besides, any self-respecting Thaumaturge such as myself would not want to be caught resorting to such mundane measures.<BR>I considered using Vis to emulate the boosting effect of a firework, but the protective durability shield of the Elytra Harness already uses Vis, and I am uncertain that Vis would be able to produce a strong, pushing force anyway. My recent discovery of the more volatile Impetus, however, opens up some new possibilities.<BR>I will need to study mundane fireworks first, and from there I can begin the process of recreating their pushing effect with a device that uses Impetus energy. I will need to be even more cautious than usual, as I will be experimenting with both explosive gunpowder and chaotic void energy. It seems that my research always leads me to danger, no matter how mundane or magical it might be...
thaumicaugmentation.research.elytra_booster.1=By emulating the explosive force of fireworks with Impetus, I can finally elevate the Elytra Harness to the level of true flight. The Impetus Thruster upgrade, as I have named it, expels stored Impetus to quickly increase my velocity in the direction I am looking.<BR>This augment can be attached and removed in the usual way: placing it with the Elytra Harness in a crafting grid to attach it, and placing the harness alone in the grid to remove it. I will also need to charge it with Impetus using one of my previously discovered methods.<BR>To activate the thruster, I only need to hold jump. To conserve Impetus, I may wish to boost in short bursts by holding down jump for short intervals, as the thruster does have a limit to how fast it can make me move.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_golemancy.title=Further Golemancy Studies
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_golemancy.0=While I have made great strides in Golemancy thus far, sometimes working with golems can be a bit... inconvenient. I should research some ways to reduce my frustration with them.

thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.title=Autocaster
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.0=I have already had success in the creation of automated weaponry, with Automated Crossbows being rather effective for use in ranged defense. However, despite the complex magical mechanisms used in their creation, they still only fire mundane arrows (although potion-tipped arrows can create some interesting effects). I personally have the option to use a different means of ranged attack in the form of foci, so I now wonder if it is possible to automate this as well.<BR>This will not be a simple matter however, since casting even simple foci requires an understanding of the ebb and flow of the magical energies involved and knowledge of how to correctly focus Vis, both of which require an intimate connection with the aura. Making a mere machine do all of this will not be an easy task.<BR>Fortunately, it seems I am not alone in this train of thought, as my recent discovery of ruins in the Emptiness has revealed ancient automatic spell-casters held within, which I may be able to reverse-enginneer in order to design my own.
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.1=This was not an easy device to finalise, but with the understanding of the ancient spell-casters and with some effort spent into better connecting machines to the Aura, I have completed my plans for what I am calling the Autocaster. Reverse-engineering the ancient device was cruicial here; it was quite ingeniously designed, and I now better understand how one can recreate the spiritual connection a sentient being might have to the Aura in something mechanical.<BR>As with the original Eldritch casters, it consists of a central sphere (an unusual choice in this distinctly cuboid world perhaps, but it seems to be the most optimized design) which contains most of the mechanisms. The sphere is gently levitated on a metal base, which allows it to rotate freely. I can place it on any solid floor, wall, or ceiling, and the Autocaster will immediately begin looking for targets. Because I integrated biothaumics into the design of this device, I can configure what it targets through its interface, accessible by right-clicking it.<BR>However, the device can do nothing without a focus. I can attach one through the Autocaster's menu, simply by placing it in the dedicated slot. With a focus attached and an appropriate target found, the device will begin using Vis from the local aura to cast spells at the target. If there is not enough Vis nearby it will fail to cast the spell, as would be expected. It is no Thaumaturge, however, so the foci cast are only as effective as those used in a basic Caster's Gauntlet. This also means that it will be unable to receive any augmentation to improve its casting. Much like my other automated devices, I can deactivate it by providing a redstone signal (as long as this feature is enabled in its menu), and interacting with the Autocaster while sneaking will allow me to pick it back up.<BR>Despite it not being as effective as a seasoned Thaumaturge like myself, it still can use nearly all of the focus effects that I can. Therefore, I could get very creative with how I use this device. Lastly, I should note that while I can configure what the Autocaster targets, this only determines what it will attempt to fire spells at. It will not change how the focus effect naturally behaves. For example, if I have a focus effect tuned to home in on a hostile target and the caster configured to target myself, then the spell will be fired in my direction but then may still home in on any hostile mobs that are in the area. I could create some very complex systems with this behavior, but I should be careful to ensure that it only does what I intend it to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.autocaster.2=With my discovery of focus effects that use Impetus in their casting process, I should note that the Autocaster will not be able to cast them without external assistance. This assistance can be in the form of any device capable of transferring normal, uncharged Impetus at a distance. The Autocaster can store a very small amount of Impetus in some of its Eldritch-derived components, but nowhere near the level of an Impetus Cell. I should ensure it has reliable access to Impetus to maintain continued operation.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.title=Focus Effect: Void Shield
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.0=With my recent expeditions into the Emptiness and the ruins that lie within it, I have discovered that certain particulary powerful creatures have the ability to summon magical shields that follow them around and block my attacks. They are quite effective at defending said creatures, and as such I would very much like to recreate them for myself.<BR>While I could settle for carrying around a physical shield, I would like to replicate the magical nature of the shields I saw. I will need to find a way to summon them on-demand, and I believe that I can do so via a special focus effect.<BR>In order to design this focus effect, I will need to study both the protective magic of warded arcana, but also the more esoteric area of Impetus. The former makes enough sense for this application, but I require the latter as summoning large semi-physical objects with Vis alone is very difficult. Impetus should provide enough force to be able to create tangible shields that follow me around.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_shield.1=By studying both Impetus and defensive foci, I have designed a new focus pattern that can create shields very similar to those used by the powerful entities in the Emptiness. This Void Shield focus effect uses the structured magical power of the praecantatio aspect, and not praemunio as I first anticipated - the latter resulted in effects that were far too static.<BR>To even use this focus effect, I will need to have Impetus available for my Caster's Gauntlet to consume, such as from a charged Impetus Conductor. Failing to have enough Impetus available will result in the shield failing to materialize.<BR>Assuming I do successfully create a shield, it will follow and protect the entity it was cast on. I can target any entity with this effect, not just myself, but missing an entity completely will result in no shield being created. If I wish to remove a summoned shield, I only need to sneak while casting the focus effect on the target. I can only remove shields that I created, however.<BR>This shield will follow its target and remain in front of their view. It will also block other creatures and projectiles from walking through it. It will never block me, and it will even allow most of my attacks to pass through unaffected. As with everything magical, however, there are always exceptions, so I should experiment ahead of time to ensure I do not accidentally damage my own shield in the heat of battle.<BR>I can control two variables relating to Void Shields in the Focal Manipulator. The first is the shield's durability, which dictates how much damage it can take before dissapating, as well as how long the shield can exist in the world for before decomposing. I also have the option of reflecting projectiles hit by the shield, causing them to bounce back in the direction they came from. Unfortunately, the shield will still take damage when reflecting projectiles.

thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.title=Focus Effect: Water
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.0=I have already managed to create multiple focus effects that harnessed the power of the primal elements. However, there is one that I have neglected thus far: Aqua. Although Gelum is similar, and water is generally seen as fairly benign, it may still be useful.<BR>I will need to examine water even more than I already have to better understand its potential. I have already managed to use Vis to conjure water with the Everfull Urn, so I have a good starting point for conjuring water by hand. I might need to personally study large amounts of water first hand, but as I can already create water this should be a trivial matter.
research.m_LONGTIMEINWATER.text=Spend some time in the deep depths.
thaumicaugmentation.research.focus_water.1=After a somewhat unpleasant and very soggy underwater experience, the power of water is now at my fingertips.<BR>This new focus effect will allow me to summon a torrent of water that can cool lava into solid blocks, fill water receptacles such as cauldrons and crucibles, hydrate farmland, and extinguish fires on surfaces and creatures. Fires will even be put out in a fairly large area around the area where it is cast, so I do not need to aim it directly at them. The water will also quickly dissipate afterwards if not aimed at a liquid container, so I do not need to worry about creating floods.<BR>While this effect's usefulness in combat is limited the majority of the time, this is not true for all creatures. The fiery blaze, as an example, will find this effect to be particulary potent. On the other hand, it will completely fail to harm mobs that are native to the water, giving them a chance to breathe on land instead. I suppose this is what is to be expected from trying to drown a fish, after all.

thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.title=Fortified Glass
thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.0=There are quite a few entries in the old manuscripts covering Warded Arcana, but one of the most unique is that of Warded Glass. While ancient Thaumaturges seem to have had little trouble in creating it, the notes covering this section are obnoxiously incomplete, and such I have been unable to properly recreate the glass so far. Despite all of my efforts, I simply cannot find a way to integrate a Warding Sigil to something that is less active than a door or chest.<BR>I could perhaps study Warded Jars a little more, but they are only warded in the sense that they are resistant to certain substances or sources of damage, so I am unsure if they will provide any inspiration. I am sure I can come up with something to show for my efforts, but it may not be quite like what is described in these manuscripts.
thaumicaugmentation.research.fortified_glass.1=While fully warded glass has to remain a dream for now, I have come reasonably close, given the limited amount of information I had to work off of. This material I am calling Fortified Glass essentially uses the same process that I use for creating Warded Jars, but scaled up to a full block.<BR>This glass is not completely indestructible, but it is very resistant to mundane damage. Explosions, for example, should be no problem for it. I also find it is rather aesthetically pleasing, so I might be able to find a use for it in decoration.<BR>Given that I managed to create a full cubic meter of this glass, creating panes out of it is rather simple. Other than the reduced size, Fortified Glass Panes retain all of the physical properties of the original.

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.title=Starfield Glass: Rift
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.0=The Void between dimensions is an inhospitable place that can hardly be called a place at all. It is hostile to life, to matter, it can house horrors I can scarecely imagine... but it is also so captivating.<BR>I cannot quite put it into words, but something about the starry void that I sometimes as the result of dimensional manipulation is so very intriguing. Given the chance, I am sure I could spend hours simply staring into it. Something tells me I should not do this, for many say one should not gaze into such an abyss, but I really cannot help myself.<BR>Despite the allure of the Void, I would rather not have to interact too closely with such dangerous dimensional magic too often. However, it should not be too difficult to create a contained breach in dimensions that can create the same effect with none of the risks involved. Or, at least, with the risks safely contained inside a piece of Fortified Glass.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_rift.1=Ah, this will be perfect. Fortified Glass was a great choice given my requirements, and now with only a very simple application of dimensional magic I can create Starfield Glass. I can now stare into the Void for as long as I desire, and there will be no need to work around unsafe dimensional anomalies in order to get a proper view.<BR>While it may look dangerous it is, in fact, perfectly safe, as the breach in dimensions is very weak and safely contained within the sturdy glass. It may also appear as if stepping into it would either lead one to The End or into a hostile abyss that would tear one to shreds in an instant, but I can rest assured that there is no risk of any unexpected teleportation, nor of any tears appearing in the fabric of reality from which untold chaos is invited into the world.<BR>Perfectly safe.<BR>Starfield Glass should be ideal for decorating anything I build. In fact, I believe that I may be able to make modifications to its appearance in the future. It would only involve some simple tweaks to the nature of the dimensional breach, or where precisely it leads to.

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.title=Starfield Glass: Mirror
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.0=Magic mirrors of all kinds send matter through the Void between worlds in order to transport it from one mirror to another. I can see into this space by looking into a linked magic mirror of any type, but my view is limited by the edges of the frame. I would very much like to get a proper look into this space, since it seems strangely different to the Void I have seen through rifts, and with a better view I might be able to learn more about it.<BR>I have already managed to create Starfield Glass that contains a view similar to that of a rift, so with some simple modifications to the dimensional breach it should be possible to make the window look into the exact space magic mirrors lead to.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_mirror.1=With only some minor adjustments to my previous Starfield Glass, I now have a new type which views the same starfield that can be seen inside magic mirrors. This variant of the glass is still perfectly safe, as the glass does not push items into a higher dimensional space like a mirror does.<BR>With this new insight gained into the space behind magic mirrors, I have learned more about its nature. From what I can tell, this space is still a Void, but it is a more compressed section of it. This unique compression of the dimensional plane allows matter to be sent through with the help of sympathetic mirror magic. While the appearance differs from that of a rift, it shares its hostility to life or anything akin to it. 

thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.title=Starfield Glass: Dimensional Fracture
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.0=With my discovery of dimensional fractures, and my recent expeditions into the Emptiness via said fractures, I have noticed that the starry sky visible in both is oddly similar and yet remarkably different to the Void visible through flux rifts. I'd quite like to get a proper look at this fascinating view... purely for research purposes, of course.<BR>This should be easy to do, as I just need to modify my previously created Starfield Glass so that it is attuned to the specific part of the Void the Emptiness exists within. It will not be stable enough to allow objects to pass through without consequences, but for visual purposes it should suffice.
thaumicaugmentation.research.starfield_glass_fracture.1=A trivial task really, and now I can build a new type of Starfield Glass which views the same sky that can be seen in the Emptiness and inside of dimensional fractures. As before, there is zero risk of cross-dimensional travel when stepping into it, and as such it is perfectly safe to use for decorating my lab or home.<BR>With all of these studies, I am starting to better grasp the truth of the Void. It is a very strange truth, with the Void seeming to be a paradoxical mix of nothing and yet also 'something', as empty space is still a tangible concept in itself (which can be seen by the presence of the Vacuos aspect). The exact 'something' is very chaotic, however as it is so vague it constantly fluctuates in numerous states that act like baseline reality, like nothing and also like something completely different to reality and nothing. These fluctuations disrupt and likely destroy anything more tangible that comes into contact with them. Furthermore, the Void is so vast that, in certain sections of it, these fluctuations may balance out to a limited degree, giving these parts particular characteristics and appearances. The factors that determine these properties I do not, and perhaps cannot, fully know.<BR>It is difficult to put into words something that actively defies them, and much still perlexes me, even with my capacity for knowledge. Perhaps I should spend some time with a proper view into the Void, so I can better enlighten myself to the vastness of the Universe and that which goes beyond it. Some may accuse me of staring into space, but 'space' would imply that there is nothing to see, which in this case is evidently not true.

thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.title=More Mechanisms
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.0=With my new access to magical types of wood and stone, I may wish to make simple mechanisms out of these materials instead of their mundane counterparts. It will not be a challenge to replicate simple contraptions, such as pressure plates and buttons, with different materials.
thaumicaugmentation.research.more_mechanisms.1=I have designed variants of pressure plates and buttons that use my new materials instead of normal wood and stone. The new wood buttons and pressure plates can be made from either silverwood or greatwood, and they act like their oak counterparts. Arcane stone acts in a similar way to average stone.<BR>One interesting note is that I only seem to be able to create these alternate mechanism designs using an arcane workbench. Whenever I attempt to build the wooden mechanisms without it, the end results look suspiciously close to oak wood. I am not quite sure why I cannot seem to keep the distinct appearance of these materials when crafting them on my own, but I suppose I should appreciate the assistance of the arcane workbench.

thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.title=Arcane Mechanisms
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.0=Redstone mechanisms are extremely versatile and useful, even to a Thaumaturge like myself. One issue with them, however, is that I cannot control who can activate them in some cases. It is all well and good to have pressure plates handle opening my doors, until I have a monster infestation in my house. With my recent rediscovery of Warded Arcana, however, I think I can solve this problem.<BR>First of all, I think my greatwood, silverwood, and arcane stone mechanisms are good candidates for this task. Not only are they visually appealing, but their aptitude for magic should make it easier for me to ward them. The only challenge left will be making the ward allow activating the mechanisms but not otherwise affecting them, but if I was able to do this to a chest, I am sure I can do the same to these devices.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.1=I have successfully created warded versions of each of the silverwood, greatwood, and arcane stone mechanisms. They will only activate by my actions alone, ignoring those created by any other entity. If they are activated, they will produce a redstone signal in the same way as their mundane counterparts.<BR>As usual, to remove a permanently warded object, I need to sneak and interact with the object while holding a caster's gauntlet to remove it.
thaumicaugmentation.research.ward_openers.2=I have discovered an interesting interaction between my arcane mechanisms and arcane doors. Despite the fact that arcane doors ignore normal redstone signals, it seems that adjacent arcane mechanisms can cause them to open if activated. This will only occur if the door recognizes the creature activating the mechanism as permitted, however, so I do not need to worry about someone using this property to bypass my Arcane Doors. I should also note that this only applies to the immediate area around the mechanisms - they are not able to be transferred over distances like redstone signals.

thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.title=Exploring the Emptiness
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.0=There is more to the Emptiness than I have once expected. One might assume a world so close to the Void could not be anything but a barren wasteland, but alongside the areas infested with taint there is something that sets my teeth on edge. Something that has pierced its way in this place like a splinter in the skin of the dimensional boundaries. I cannot be too surprised, as reality here is far more malleable due to the many fractures that have been made in it, and how one wrong step can send me tumbling into an inhospitable abyss. With reality that unstable, it was almost guaranteed that some malicious influence would appear or otherwise make its way here - if they were not here from the beginning.<BR>For a while now, I have slowly been coming to the realization that the Eldritch may refer to far more than a branch of Thaumaturgy, or to knowledge that can twist one’s mind with Warp. The Crimson Rites, in particular, was filled with uses of the phrase ‘The Eldritch’ in ways that would put it far above that, in a way that would suggest that merely knowing that such things exist is something reserved to those who are destined to go beyond the mundane world I have come to know. To them, uttering the phrase must be almost blasphemous, something that no ordinary being should ever be allowed to do, let alone a Thaumaturge such as myself.<BR>No, the Eldritch cannot simply refer to this branch of magic centered around the Void. Instead, I believe it refers to a race of beings that have existed for a very, very long time, and who have had an effect on the world that has shaped much of what I treat as fact, or as being perfectly normal. If they exist, it could explain many of the oddities I have discovered, particular quirks in magical principles, why certain creatures are present in the world, and how some can lose their minds so utterly that they form sects made entirely of madmen dedicated to a ritual that can do nothing good.<BR>If I am to fully understand any of this, I will have to explore the Emptiness further, to discover what exactly is causing this disturbance in the aura. This Eldritch influence will almost certainly be hostile to something as comparatively small as myself, but knowledge often requires risk, and I cannot turn back now. Not with the power that such knowledge may offer me.
research.m_ENTERSPIRE.text=Discover something peculiar in the Emptiness.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.1=I have found something in the Emptiness. Ruins, ancient, created and placed here for a reason I do not know, although I am certain it is the work of the Eldritch. I can feel the disturbance in the surrounding magic field very strongly here, so this is precisely what I was looking for. Or, perhaps, these ruins contain what I am looking for.<BR>The ruins themselves are made up of many different parts, a series of chambers built around a central spire. At the bottom of this spire are a set of unusual doors, constructed using a form of magic that I am not entirely familiar with, although I do recognize the the presence of dimensional magic within their mechanisms. The lock at their centre seems to be a receptor for something, and I believe impetus might be the key. A charged impetus conductor attached to a caster's gauntlet should suffice - I only need to use it on the lock to open the door and unleash whatever lurks inside.<BR>While I cannot find out more until I enter the ruins, one important thing I have noticed is that a powerful protective ward is being held upon these ruins, likely by a powerful force within them. Until I enter these ruins and destroy the source of this power, I will be unable to break my way through the dungeon. Some chunks of stone seem to have been damaged over time, however, and the ward seems to have faded from these locations. In the event I find any of these weakened segments blocking my path, I should be able to break them freely.<BR>Given the size, complexity, and unnerving feel of these ruins, whatever lurks within them will almost certainly pose a threat to me. If I am not properly prepared for a fight, I should probably head back home and make preparations before I continue. Having come so far, it would truly be a shame to die now at the hands of that which I am trying so hard to fully understand.
research.m_BOSSROOM.text=Uncover the secrets of the Eldritch Spire.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.2=This room... this altar... I have seen this before! Pages within the Crimson Rites held drawings, within which were depicted such strange things, all around an altar just like this one! I can see that this is the very heart of the spire, it holds the protective ward in place and corrupts the aura around it. However, the altar is unbreakable, so I must find another way to stop its influence.<BR>...I know what I must do. Apertis Oculis. I must Open the Eye of the altar. I know very little about the ritual, so little that I do not know what will happen once I perform it, but I can see that the altar is fully prepared, so all I need to do is use my Casting Gauntlet on the central pedestal to cast the final invocation.<BR>I should prepare for what happens next, whatever it is cannot be good. Something powerful is watching me here. I can feel it.
research.m_ELDRITCHBOSS.text=Open the Eye.
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_spire.3=When I performed the ritual, Apertis Oculis, at the altar, I was not sure what I was expecting to happen. Perhaps I thought it would have simply stopped the spire’s influence on the area around it. Really, I should have known better. It was never going to be that easy.<BR>The powerful being that appeared from the portal was the true source of the ruins’ corruption, the altar was merely an anchor for it to hold onto across the dimensional planes. However, after forcing it into the Emptiness via the ritual I was able to kill it, and I can feel that the dimensional boundaries have stabilized somewhat, meaning that the protective ward that previously stopped me from damaging the structure has also dissipated. If I wish to do so, I can more freely explore the ruins and mine the various blocks that make them up; I may be able to find some additional trinkets and collect a nice variety of new building materials for me to use.<BR>Aside from that, I discovered something interesting that the spire’s apparent curator left behind: a set of tattered scrolls. I do not know why the being dropped them nor how such ancient scrolls have managed to survive intact, but after scanning them I can see that they contain knowledge incredibly useful to me, most likely about Auromancy and Impetus. These will be the key to my continued research; I shall write about them more in a further entry.<BR>Despite my success in stopping the malicious force that these ruins held, I can sense that the aura in the Emptiness is still twisted. I am certain that other Eldritch Spires may be found there, each containing another ritual altar anchoring another malevolent being to it. If I so wish, I can repeat what I have already done and fight my way through them. While this will be tiring, I will almost certainly gain more useful trinkets and resources. For future reference, the first door of the spire is opened with impetus cast from a gauntlet, the various other doors are opened with keys found throughout other parts of the spire, and the ritual altar in the final room can be forced to summon the spire’s master by using my casting gauntlet on it.<BR>After all of this, I am left with some questions though. What is the true purpose of these spires? Why do they hold such useful trinkets and resources? Will I find further copies of these ancient scrolls as well? What are these beings, and how have they become so powerful? I believe it is no accident that I found these notes, but I cannot stop now.

thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_epiphany.title=Eldritch Epiphany
thaumicaugmentation.research.eldritch_epiphany.0=I have made excellent progress with translating the ancient scrolls, and while what I have learned is perhaps not what I expected, it is precisely what I needed. As I suspected, the parts I translated cover two main areas of magic: Auromancy and Impetus. I shall cover each area separately.<BR>Firstly, Auromancy. This was one of the areas of translation that confused me the most, and for a very good reason: it seems that the aura of the distant past was quite different than the one I am familiar with. The aura in its current state is a field of magical energy, vis, that exists in higher dimensions and which permeates through many dimensional planes in fluctuating amounts. Certain areas and dimensions have weaker dimensional boundaries thus more vis is able to seep in, and the inverse is equally true. However, these scrolls reveal that the aura was not always like this, and that the connection to the other side was once far more tangible and focused, semi-physically present in the form of ‘Aura Nodes’. Vis would have to be directly drawn from these nodes in order to cast spells or operate devices, instead of simply drawing it from the surrounding area. Furthermore, the vis would come naturally attuned to different aspects, as opposed to having to manually attune the vis via essentia crystals or foci. This explains some of the oddities in design I noticed about the older wands I abandoned in favour of my gauntlets: they were designed for a very different version of the aura.<BR>Something very clearly happened to the aura nodes, and based on some rough theory working I have performed I can ascertain that they dispersed over a very long period of time. Initially, they spread out to a limited degree, with nodes feeding the surrounding area with different types of vis (meaning that at this period of time drawing vis directly from nodes for use in magic was not viable, and instead it was drawn from the area like I do now). Eventually, this dispersion became so severe that the nodes vanished entirely, leaving only numerous tiny invisible dimensional cracks from which pure non-attuned vis could flow through. However, I am fearful as to what may have induced this process. At first I thought it might have been a natural process, the aura gradually evolving over the aeons, but this does not seem right. There are, however, some strong hints at a true answer revealed by the next section.<BR>Secondly, the scrolls provided some tantalizing hints about impetus and how I might be able to better manipulate it. Notably, the text in this section of the notes is hastily scrawled, and the tone within seems to be far more urgent. While the writer seemed perplexed as to the nature of impetus (a feeling I can attest to), they did manage to provide me with a formula for a specialized jewel that can effectively resonate impetus energy, which should allow me to properly focus, transport and use it. In essence, I should be able to transmit impetus in the form of energy beams, given some extra research.<BR>I am a little puzzled as to the somewhat contradictory nature of the ancient mage’s understanding of impetus though. Apparently, they had struggled to find a way to create impetus reliably, despite their knowledge of how to properly focus and transmit it. With regards to the latter point, I believe it may be because they already had familiarity with using the ancient form of vis in a more focused fashion, transporting vis energy beams via crystal relays instead of drawing the energy from the surrounding area, and thus they had a starting point for which to use with impetus transfer. As for the former point, this implies something far more sinister.<BR>The only reason I can see for an accomplished ancient Thaumaturge being unable to reliably create impetus is that they did not have access to all of the magical phenomena that I do. If the nature of vis and the aura has changed over the aeons, then might that mean the nature of flux has never been fully consistent either? The presence of aura nodes would almost certainly have a big impact on how it would behave, and while I am not sure, I think the creation of flux rifts might not have been possible in their presence. If this is true, then there would be no reliable way to summon impetus energy, and thus an ancient Thaumaturge would have to rely on some other, likely far more dangerous, means of obtaining it.<BR>This troubles me. If flux rifts are a recent phenomenon, at least in terms of the vast timescales that entire universes operate by, then might this mean that something is forcefully attempting to shape reality in order to enable their creation? While this could be an entirely natural process, something about this all strikes me as so utterly twisted. What is happening to the aura to make it so… corrupt? If some malicious force wanted the creation of flux rifts to be possible, then perhaps it would explain the ancient aura nodes’ gradual disappearance, since without them there is nothing to prevent flux rifts from opening in high flux areas. But if this is all true, then why would this force want flux rifts to be opened at all, and how would it be able to manipulate the aura so entirely so to make aura nodes vanish? Do dimensional fractures and the Emptiness play a part here perhaps?<BR>I am loath to fully admit it, but if this is all true then I can only think of one force powerful enough to induce such a change in our world. The Eldritch. They want something with our world, with those who occupy it, with the Crimson Cult, with me, but I do not know what that is. I don't even know if I would be able to fully comprehend the answer if it was right in front of me. But I must continue my research nonetheless, because with this discovery I have been granted a great potential for power, and I know I can use this power to bend reality as I see fit. They will not stop me. Some might say they would travel to Hell and back to see their goals through, but the Nether is nothing next to the places I have been to, all to further my understanding of the forces that underlie magic.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus.title=Expanded Impetus
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus.0=With the wisdom I have gained from the scrolls of old, I believe I am now ready to fully unlock the potential of impetus. Previously I was able to use it to create void seeds, and after that collection and storage through manual use of a caster’s gauntlet, but with only a little more research I should be able to use the turbulent forces of the Void to do a great deal more than that.<BR>I already have a recipe for what is known as an Impetus Jewel, and while I know what it does in theory, I must now actually create one to see how it behaves in practice. The jewel, however, will only be capable of resonating impetus to receive and transmit it directly; therefore, I still need a way to draw impetus out of a flux rift in the first place. Fortunately, I have already done this previously, firstly with a Void Siphon and secondly with an Impetus Conductor. The former seems more appropriate a starting point for what I am aiming for, that being automatic collection of raw impetus. However, a Void Siphon requires a nether star, so I should probably endeavor to find a way to avoid needing them at all.<BR>Despite the effort this will take, these next steps will still be far simpler than getting past the dead-end I faced previously. At least I now have all of the fundamental knowledge required to actually do this.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus.1=Now. Now I can truly begin to use impetus.<BR>Using the schematics I had previously created for the Void Siphon, I was able to modify the design so I could create the fundamental devices that can automatically collect, transport, resonate and distribute impetus. I shall cover how can one properly set up an impetus power system, and to do this I shall break it all down into separate parts that cover the different concepts, tools and devices involved.<BR>Before I begin, however, I feel I must note that when it comes to learning something new, more often than not the best way to understand something is to experiment with it physically. I should also note that impetus is complex topic for one to understand, and I would not be surprised if I happen to forget certain parts or get confused about impetus power mechanisms. Thus, if I am at all confused by what I am detailing, I might find it helpful to create and experiment with a few simple impetus energy setups so to better understand the principles involved firsthand. I suppose that I will have to see whether I prefer careful study or practical experimentation in order to fully understand this complicated and dangerous topic.<PAGE>Charged Impetus<DIV>Previously I only had access to impetus fairly indirectly, through the void seeds it created and the impetus stored in conductors attached to gauntlets. But with my new discoveries I am now able to gather impetus in a different more energetic form. I am calling this new form of impetus ‘Charged Impetus’. I shall cover the distinction between the two.<BR>Normal impetus can be seen as lines of starry void trailing through the air, and is usually directly pulled from a flux rift. It is what I have been using up until now and is what void siphons and impetus conductors use. Devices accessing normal impetus tend to be able to idly draw it from an impetus source, again, this usually being in the form of a flux rift. Notably, it is harmless for one to touch normal impetus trails… at least, probably, but they do at least seem to pass through me without any damage done.<BR>Charged impetus, however, is more volatile and therefore has a great deal more potential use. By making it take this charged form, I can transfer larger amounts of impetus over longer distances. It is what will power my planned specialized machinery, and can be seen in the world as beams of energy, which vary from faint to bright depending on how much charged impetus is being sent through them. Another difference from normal impetus is that charged impetus must be specifically directed to devices that use it, as opposed to drawing it from a nearby rift. I shall detail later on in this entry how to create charged impetus.<BR>For the sake of safety, I should note that an active beam of charged impetus has enough compacted energy to be rather deadly, and if I am caught between one then I will be hurt. Inactive beams, however, are safe. An inactive beam can be seen as faint wisps of energy, while an active beam glows bright and can be clearly seen.<PAGE>Impetus Nodes<DIV>Blocks placed in the world that connect to beams of charged impetus are collectively referred to as ‘impetus nodes’. To clarify: they have no relation to aura nodes. It does not matter whether a device creates, uses, or simply transfers charged impetus, if it connects to charged impetus beams in one form or another then it is classified as an impetus node.<BR>Impetus nodes have set numbers of input and output slots, which dictate how many beams of charged impetus can feed into and be sent out of them. Impetus nodes, therefore, can be designed so to transfer energy from one to the other, so a source of charged impetus can output energy into a node, and this node can output energy into another node, and so on and so forth. Different nodes have different numbers of input and output slots, for instance a device that creates charged impetus will only have output slots, a device that transfers charged impetus will have both inputs and outputs, and a device that uses charged impetus will only have input slots.<PAGE>Impetus Resonator<DIV>With impetus nodes having been detailed, there still needs to be a way to define how impetus nodes are connected to one another. For such a purpose, I have designed the Impetus Resonator.<BR>The Impetus Resonator is a tool which can modify the connections an impetus node has. By holding the device in hand and then sneaking and right-clicking an impetus node of any kind, said node will be clearly highlighted in blue and selected for modification. If I sneak right-click the same node again, it will be deselected.<BR>With an impetus node selected, I can then connect it to another node by right-clicking without sneaking on said other node. By doing this, the first node has been set to output energy into the second one, taking up an output slot on the first node and an input slot on the second. If I right-click the second node again, then the connection will be removed. To send energy from one node into multiple other ones, then I simply select the first node via sneak right-click and then right-click all the other nodes one-by-one. I should keep in mind the slot limitations when doing this, however. Also of note is that impetus beams can only travel so far, at a distance of around eight meters, and they cannot travel through opaque walls. Glass or other transparent materials will permit impetus beams to pass through them, however. I will need to ensure that impetus nodes are kept fairly close together and that they are not obstructed by walls in order to link them together properly.<BR>If I select an impetus node that already has connections defined, then I can also see these connections visualized. Any nodes that feed impetus into the selected node are highlighted in red, and any nodes the selected node sends impetus out to are highlighted in green. In the special case of a node being both an input and output of the selected node, it will be highlighted in purple. If am at all uncertain, I can also see in which direction impetus will travel based on which direction the beams are flowing.<BR>While the Impetus Resonator can define how nodes are connected to one another, very little will happen if no charged impetus is actually being fed into the system, which is where the Impetus Drainer comes in.<PAGE>Impetus Drainer<DIV>The Impetus Drainer is an important impetus node that creates charged impetus energy when placed next to a flux rift. Based on the Void Siphon, it has a dense piece void metal on top which draws in normal impetus (fortunately, the nether star was not needed here, since the siphon's only use for it is to coalesce normal impetus into void seeds), and using a rotating mechanism it charges the impetus and transmits it into an impetus jewel at its centre. It can therefore be seen as the heart of a charged impetus generation system. When the Drainer draws impetus out of a rift, the rift in question will gradually begin to shrink and become unstable, as with the Void Siphon. Draining a smaller rift will result in it drawing less impetus than if the rift was larger. Therefore, I should ensure that I keep an eye on the rift I am draining to ensure that it remains stable and sizable.<BR>The device itself has one impetus beam output slots and no inputs, since it creates charged impetus. Therefore, to send energy out of it and into other impetus nodes, I only need to sneak right-click it with the Impetus Resonator and then right-click on the other nodes in question.<BR>If I wish to disable the device, I only need to provide it with a redstone signal. This will stop the device from draining any nearby rifts and from creating impetus, so I can use this to ensure that I do not drain a flux rift too much.<PAGE>Impetus Relay<DIV>Probably the simplest type of impetus node, the Impetus Relay is simply a way to transport beams of impetus from one place to another. It has two input slots and two output slots, so I have some room to tinker with routing in my energy transport systems.<PAGE>Impetus Diffuser<DIV>This device can be seen as the inverse of the Impetus Drainer, since it takes in charged impetus and diffuses normal impetus from the top. Therefore, it can be used to power any devices that drain flux rifts directly, such as gauntlets with impetus resonators attached or void siphons. It has one input slot and no output slots, since it is a device that consumes charged impetus.<BR>I should note that the Diffuser cannot power the Impetus Drainer, since that could create feedback problems where normal impetus is converted to charged impetus, which is converted back to normal via the diffuser, which is then is sent back into the drainer which converts it to charged, which is sent back to the diffuser, etc.<BR>Of note is that using this device to power normal impetus devices will in fact be better for them than having them drain a rift directly. The charging process actively improves the efficiency of impetus creation, so it should be well worth the effort to use my new impetus power systems even with my older machines.<BR>As with the Drainer, I can turn the device off with a redstone signal, which will therefore prevent it from powering normal impetus devices.<BR>This covers the basics of charged impetus power systems. Despite my progress, I know that I have much more to learn and create, both with devices that transmit impetus but also those that use it.<BR>There is so much potential here, my mind is spinning with so many possibilities…

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.title=Impetus Gate
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.0=Charged impetus power networks are already a rather complex topic to understand completely, consisting of many parts beyond just connecting nodes together. At the moment, I have no way to restrict the power transfer between two nodes without permanently severing the connection between them. This limitation exists due to the fact that I have not found a reasonable way to block an impetus beam within an impetus node itself; I can only redirect the beam.<BR>Normally, I would turn to redstone, as it excels at inhibiting magic. However, even redstone cannot fully inhibit a charged impetus beam, as the magical energy is just far too concentrated for it to handle. Thankfully, my studies into warding arcana may prove useful here. The protective magic that it covers could be indirectly used to "protect" something like an impetus relay from receiving a charged power beam, with this protective behaviour being adjustable within the device itself. I'll need to study this further in order to get the exact behaviour I need.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_gate.1=I have confirmed that with some careful combination warded arcana and mundane redstone, it is possible to temporarily block charged impetus beams as I desired. When no redstone signal is given to the device, it acts as a normal impetus relay. When the redstone signal is applied, the protective shield enters a semi-solid state and prevents charged impetus from passing through in either direction. If the signal is removed, the shield will quickly dissipate and charged impetus can pass through as normal.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.title=Impetus Matrix
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.0=The charged impetus power I have discovered does have a great deal of future potential, being more volatile and immediately powerful than vis, and more flexible than the standard form of impetus I have used in the past. However, one major limitation of dealing with impetus in large amounts is the fact that it cannot be stored in any capacity after it has been extracted. Simply treating a flux rift as an impetus battery will only get me so far, as I have to work around the rift's precarious stability, not to mention the inability to extract more controlled amounts of impetus from it. Therefore, a means of storing larger quantities of impetus in a safe, or at least safer, manner would be ideal.<BR>I have already had success in storing small amounts of normal impetus. Looking at it from a wider perspective, I have done it through a fair few ways: in an impetus conductor for use in a casting gauntlet, in its coalesced and semi-physical form of a void seed, and most importantly inside a purpose-built impetus cell. These methods are all viable for normal impetus because while impetus itself is always volatile, it is nowhere near the levels of charged impetus. The crux of the problem is finding a way to keep it from growing too unruly while in storage, while also keeping it readily accessible at a moment's demand.<BR>After some time spent pondering this dilemma, I believe I might be able to achieve this. From what I can tell, unstable charged impetus is rather similar to the instability one can experience in a poorly maintained infusion process. When I was perfecting the art of infusion, I created the runic matrix to help regulate and stabilize infusions, and I think I may be able to reuse it in order to safely contain charged impetus. The exact implementation will almost certainly differ, of course, but I am confident that the idea is sound in principle.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_matrix.1=I originally spent a great deal of time and effort designing a way to manage complex arcane infusions. It seems that even after meeting its initial goal, that effort has lead to a breakthrough yet again. Combined with a retaining structure similar to the aura node management devices of old, I have created a device I am calling the Impetus Matrix. Despite this not being the first time I have retrofitted an ancient design related to these nodes to support impetus, I am still left wondering if there is something greater hiding in the similarities between the two systems. I will make a mental note to return to this train of thought at a later date, for the Impetus Matrix deserves my immediate attention.<BR>To create an Impetus Matrix, I need to place a runic matrix between two eldritch pedestals, with one pedestal above and the other below the matrix. As with all mystical constructs, I need to use a pinch of Salis Mundus to form the full structure, and breaking any individual piece will revert it back to its discrete components.<BR>Once assembled, the Impetus Matrix requires some additional preparation to begin storing charged impetus. Firstly, impetus cells need to be inserted into the pedestals to act as the main storage receptacle. To insert a cell, I simply need to use it on the side of the pedestal I wish to insert it into. Each pedestal can hold up to four cells, one per side, for a maximum of eight total cells. The Matrix will be functional with even only a single cell. However, adding more cells will allow the Impetus Matrix to contain more charged impetus, as well as transfer more of that impetus in and out of the Matrix over a shorter period of time. Should I wish to remove a cell, I need to use the pedestal with an empty hand on the side containing the cell. Unfortunately, any excess impetus the remaining cells cannot store will be lost when doing this, so I should take care to not be wasteful.<BR>Secondly, the Matrix will need to be stabilized. When charged impetus is stored within the matrix, it will gradually begin to lose stability, with this stability loss growing as more charged impetus is stored. To stop this stability loss, I simply need to place the same occult paraphernalia that I use for the same purpose near infusion altars. The stability zone of the Impetus Matrix is smaller than that of the infusion altar, encompassing a five by five meter area. I still need to ensure that the objects are placed in symmetrical patterns around the central point of the Matrix, unless I want it to be even more unstable than without the objects. The same occurance of diminishing returns as I place the same kind of object occurs with the Impetus Matrix, so I may need to obtain many different items to store large amounts of charged impetus.<BR>Should the Impetus Matrix ever become unstable, it will begin to induce unpleasant effects around it, much like unstable infusions. It may discharge some of the stored impetus as bolts of harmful energy, knock impetus cells out of the pedestal, among some other harmful effects. Fortunately, the instability of an Impetus Matrix is less potent than that of an infusion, given the fact that it is not regulating an active crafting process with constant barrages of magical energy. This means that I will not need as many objects to have the Matrix reach a stable state as I might need for an infusion altar. I can also see the total stability gain and loss, as well as the approximate stability state, of the Impetus Matrix by looking at the central Runic Matrix with a pair of Goggles of Revealing.<BR>Finally, after following all of these steps, the Impetus Matrix will be ready to safely store charged impetus. The usual method of using an Impetus Resonator to direct impetus beams into and out of the Matrix applies here, with it being able to accept one input and one output. The colored runes on the matrix will show a rough approximation of how full the attached impetus cells are. Red represents a completely empty Matrix, yellow is partially filled, and bright green runes signify it being full. I can also attach a redstone comparator to any part of the Impetus Matrix to create a redstone signal that corresponds to the same information.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.title=Impetus Mirror
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.0=Long-distance transfer of charged impetus is a bit of a problem for me at the moment; because impetus beams can only travel a set distance, I need a great amount of relays and patience to link far away nodes together. There has to be a better way to go about doing this than the brute-force approach.<BR>Long distance transfer is something I have already successfully done with magic mirrors, but only with items and aerated essentia. It should be possible to use the same method to remotely connect impetus beams from one mirror to another, but it will require some special modifications to prevent the impetus from being ripped out of its concentrated, charged form. Since magic mirrors send materials through some corner of the Void, the impetus will naturally want to escape the mirrors and return to the realm it is more familiar with.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_mirror.1=Despite the unusual nature of impetus, I have successfully managed to apply the principles of mirror magic to it, and I now have access to long-distance charged impetus transfer in the form of the Impetus Mirror. The mirror's design has obviously had to go under some adjustment, and therefore requires some more esoteric materials to craft it, but despite this it functions very similarly to any other kind of magic mirror.<BR>To use the mirror, I first need to create the usual pair of mirrors, place one in the world and use the second mirror on the placed one, linking the two together. I then simply place the second mirror at another location, and charged impetus beams can be sent through them. As with other magic mirrors, this link works across any distance and even across dimensions. However, the usual phenomenon of time seeming to stand still in places I am far away from still applies, so I will need to either be near the mirrors or set up a device counteract this effect if I want two mirrors that are very far away from each other to link.<BR>I can use the Impetus Resonator to connect inputs and outputs to the mirrors like any other node. Each mirror has a single input and output available for my use. This is separate from the intrinsic connection between two linked mirrors, which is effectively a bidirectional impetus link between them.<BR>While I am overall very pleased with the flexibility the mirrors offer me, they have a few limitations. The speed of impetus transfer had to be capped to prevent it from being torn apart in the Void, so I may need to be a bit more clever if I need high-throughput transfer. These mirrors also place the same strain on the aura as the other types of mirrors do, so frequently using the mirrors to transfer impetus will cause it to generate flux at both mirrors. Lastly, mirrors are much more expensive to craft than something comparatively simple like an Impetus Relay, so I should try to intelligently design my impetus setups to minimize their usage.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_management.title=Rift Management
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_management.0=As my usage of flux rifts increases, the rifts themselves seem to be fighting back. Not unexpected for a volatile tear in the fabric of magic, but I need to find ways to better manage them. An unstable rift is incredibly dangerous, prone to destroying whatever is around it.<BR>Before I begin investigating means of managing rifts, however, I shall first compile some notes on their behaviour I have noticed while working with them.<BR>Rifts form when too much flux appears in the local aura, around three-fourths of the total vis cap to be precise - a fact that I learned the hard way. If I am wearing Goggles of Revealing, I can faintly see the rift through the terrain, so if a rift appears in an unknown location I can use those to help locate it. The rift will continue to absorb the excess flux in the aura, growing in size as it does so. However, if there is no more flux to sustain the rift, it will become more and more unstable. There is also a point where even in the presence of flux, the rift cannot sustain its growth. This effectively sets a maximum size that rifts that naturally grow to.<BR>I have also observed some interesting characteristics about a rift's stability. A rift gains stability from absorbing flux, or, in its absence, by inducing an instability event to expunge some of its unstable energy. I can also stabilize a rift with the redstone-based stabilizers I created for use in infusion. Using a stabilizer like this does present a problem in that it generates more flux than a single rift consumes, but I suppose it will have to do until I devise a better method for stabilizing rifts.<BR>One way of identifying a rift's stability at a glance is through its movement. A perfectly stable rift will appear to be perfectly stationary, but as it loses stability it will begin pulsing and shifting. If the rift starts releasing small wisps of energy, it has reached the point where it will create chaotic disruptions at any moment. I believe that these wisps are the rift discharging its unstable energies, with this energy coming from the chaotic Void on the other side of the rift which is "shaped" by the rift into unpleasant flux-related chaos.<BR>Instability effects vary, but they are unpleasant and potentially lethal. One of the most common events is the rift condensing the flux into a physical form, namely through a taint seed. If the seed is not quickly removed, the area around it will become a flux-filled mess, potentially setting off a chain reaction of more rifts forming. Other events include the release of proper wisps, the ones that zap anything that comes too close, as well as clouds of flux forming in the vicinity. In rare circumstances, the rift may naturally collapse, sealing the breach in reality on its own. This is the same process that is induced by a causality collapser, but occurs so infrequently that it probably is not worth waiting for.<BR>Finally, I should note that a flux rift's connection to the Void means that it interacts with physical matter in destructive ways. Flux rifts are capable of consuming all but the most durable of materials if they grow into them, not even leaving an item behind. Living matter will similarly be quickly destroyed on contact.<BR>With these behaviours documented, I believe I am now prepared to design some tools to better manage these rifts. Despite how dangerous they are, I know that they are crucial to my continued attempts to unlock all of the secrets Thaumaturgy has to offer.

thaumicaugmentation.research.void_recharge_pedestal.title=Void Recharge Pedestal
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_recharge_pedestal.0=Since I now have access to more handheld or portable items that use impetus in their operation, I should look into better methods to supply them with that impetus. Currently I can use the Impetus Diffuser to charge them up, but there are two major downsides to using it: firstly that the diffuser outputs only a very slow trickle of impetus into items, taking a long time to charge them up fully, and secondly it can only charge items that I am either holding out in my hand or that I have equipped on my person. These problems are the result of the diffuser outputting normal impetus in the area around it, so if I were to design a method of charging items up with a more direct beam of charged impetus then it would almost certainly limit these prior issues.<BR>At first I was a little lost about where to start with this task, but after some thinking I believe I can use my old Recharge Pedestal as a starting point. Vis and impetus have some interesting similarities, and the old notes I found referenced methods of using the long-forgotten node-drawn CV in order to charge thaumaturgy’s ancient wands. With these two pieces of knowledge in mind, I believe I can create a new form of Recharge Pedestal that takes in a beam of charged impetus and rapidly charges any items placed on top of it.<BR>Hopefully I can create something good out of this, I’d rather not have to sit next to a diffuser for any longer than I have to, especially considering that even the faint trails of impetus make me somewhat... uneasy.
thaumicaugmentation.research.void_recharge_pedestal.1=The Void Recharge Pedestal is now ready to be built, and it should be far better for charging individual items with impetus than the diffuser I’ve only had access to up until now. I’ve taken the basic design of the standard Recharge Pedestal, replaced the standard magical components with more Void-related ones and tweaked the piece on top so it can better channel impetus energy.<BR>When built and placed in the world, I can prepare the new pedestal simply by directing a beam of charged impetus energy into it (using the Impetus Resonator as normal), and then once any empty or partially filled impetus using items are placed into the pedestal a beam of impetus energy will be fed into the item. The item should charge far, far more rapidly than with the diffuser, although I should make sure not to step into the active beam of impetus while I charge the item.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon.title=Impulse Cannon
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon.0=With the secrets of impetus power being gradually revealed to me, I believe it is time to put them to use in a somewhat... unsubtle manner. Impetus is naturally more volatile than vis, and after some pondering I am left with a grim yet intriguing question: what if I were to try and weaponise it?<BR>Initially, I thought it might be possible to do this via a focus effect, where the effect would channel impetus from a connected impetus conductor and unleash it as destructive energy. However, it would require great concentration on my part. Even the slightest lapse in attention would result in the impetus backfiring, destroying the focus before killing me, no doubt in a very unpleasant way. Additionally, even if such a focus posed no danger to me, the impetus conductor is a low-power device that is not suitable for the large burst of impetus that a weapon directly harnessing it requires.<BR>All of these problems are the result of me trying to apply an entirely new source of power to a casting method not inherently designed to accommodate it. If I were to instead build a device that can properly contain, stabilize, and fire the impetus, then I will almost certainly have far more success. I will also not be reduced to a pile of ashes drifting gently away from a smouldering crater.<BR>I unfortunately see no better trial to determine if this idea has merit than subjecting myself to the touch of a charged impetus beam. I have previously noted that the beams traveling between relays can damage living creatures, so if I have not already (whether deliberately or as a result of a mishap), I should touch one of them. It also must be in the process of transferring charged impetus, as the passive beams between nodes are harmless. I should also prepare some devices capable of stabilizing magic - I have the feeling that I will need them.
research.f_IMPETUSDAMAGE.text=Feel the sting of charged Impetus
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon.1=This... this may very well be my magnum opus. The plans laid out before me fill me with a strange mixture of emotions: awe, intrigue, horror… perhaps even wonder. I am ready to create what may be one of the most dangerous and powerful devices that can be made with the disciplines of thaumaturgy, which I have called the Impulse Cannon. It uses the raw force of impetus and unleashes it as a deadly beam of energy, which can deal impressive amounts of damage to anything it catches.<BR>The design of the cannon itself took rather a lot of work in order to finalize, and even then the result is a touch unrefined; despite its potential for power, it is still something of an experimental weapon. As an overall description of how it works, the device stores impetus within the main body at the back of it, and then sends it through the central focusing chamber underneath a strip of redstone inlay. This inlay is stabilized by a miniature infusion stabilizer that steadies the beam. The impetus is then transmitted through a modified casting focus at the tip, which fires a continuous beam of energy. I then augmented the design with a grip and firing trigger underneath the main body, a handle on the focusing barrel, and a stock at the back so that I can properly hold it. With all this in mind, the device requires a lot of advanced components and materials to fully build, with the final assembly process being a very dangerous arcane infusion, so if I am to build it then I should be aware of the difficulty and potential danger that lies ahead.<BR>If I do create an Impulse Cannon, then to properly use it I first need to charge it up with impetus energy. Once charged, I then hold the cannon and simply use it in order to fire it. The beam that it creates goes a fair distance, and deals continuous damage to any monster, animal or otherworldly horror that it touches. The power of the Void does not discriminate in what it harms, and will also cut through armour to a limited extent. As one would expect, the stored impetus within the device is quite rapidly used up when the beam is fired, and I can see how much impetus is left within it by either looking at the device in my inventory or by looking at a gauge on the device while I hold it.<BR>As a final note, I have also made sure the device is open to further modification in future, and thus there is the potential for further augmentation in order to change how the device operates. Notably, the focusing chamber is very modifiable, so I could change how the cannon fires the beam of impetus energy.<BR>Such a powerful weapon. I cannot let it fall into the wrong hands. It should be mine alone to use.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_railgun.title=Impulse Cannon: Railgun Conversion
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_railgun.0=The Impulse Cannon in its current state is a very effective weapon, although there are some limitations to the beam it creates. The damage output is good, but it does not instantly rip things apart as I hoped, and furthermore it can only travel so far before the beam cannot sustain itself and promptly dissipates.<BR>However, since I have left the cannon open for further modification, I may be able to create an augment that changes how it fires. In this particular case, I think I might have some success with firing a set amount of energy all in one go, as opposed draining a continuous amount for a consistent beam. To do this, I will need to modify the central focusing chamber with an additional lens. This shouldn’t be too hard to do, especially since the bulk of the work with actually creating the cannon itself is all done.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_railgun.1=I have completed my work on this particular augment for the Impulse Cannon. This augment changes how the device fires quite radically, so calling it a ‘conversion kit’ seems more appropriate.<BR>This kit, called the Railgun Conversion Kit, converts the cannon into a weapon that fires a single beam of energy in one go, which travels further than the ordinary beam, does a great deal more damage in one hit and can penetrate through multiple targets. However, this comes at the major cost of requiring the cannon to cool down in between shots, which takes quite a long time since the stabilizer needs to expunge a larger amount of energy before the cannon is safe to use again.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_burst.title=Impulse Cannon: Burst-fire Conversion
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_burst.0=Since I have left the Impulse Cannon open for any further augmentation I may wish to add, I may as well spend some time creating one to change how the weapon fires. One way to go would be to fire a set amount of energy all at once, but I may also have some success in using a set amount of energy to fire multiple small beams.<BR>I’ll need to create a set of lenses that modulate the impetus beam so that it is spaced out over set intervals of time, these lenses being placed in the focusing chamber where the beam travels through.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impulse_cannon_augment_burst.1=The schematics for this augment, which I am calling the Burst-fire Conversion Kit, are now complete.<BR>The augment, when built and attached to the cannon in the usual manner of placing it in a crafting window with said cannon, changes the firing method so that it fires three beams in a short burst, which each do a fair bit more damage than the normal beam. This comes with the price of having a cooldown after each shot, which isn’t too long but does leave me exposed for a second or two.

thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_terraformer.title=Arcane Terraformer
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_terraformer.0=For some time now, I have pondered the possibility of artificially manipulating the natural world around me in ways normally impossible. For instance, while it is possible for anyone with enough time, strength, and resourcefulness to manipulate the terrain around them to fit their needs, they cannot truly change the underlying biomes that the area exists within. I have desired to break this rule enforced upon the world by all of reality, but the magic I have had access to has not been enough to change this fact.<BR>At least, until now. My studies into the volatile and transmutative properties of impetus have now opened a door for me, one that leads to the possibility of true world-manipulating power. Even with this knowledge, changing the underlying biomes in the world will require a great deal of magical force and a certain level of ingenuity, given that I will need to permanently alter the aura around me to successfully terraform an area.<BR>To gain an insight into the momumentous task ahead of me, I will need to open my mind to the wider world around me and see the many sights and sounds it offers. This means exploring and visiting a few different biomes in the world, to see how reality fundamentally operates in them and observe the subtle changes in this operation between biomes.
research.m_OCEAN.text=Visit a place where the land and sea meet
research.m_MOUNTAIN.text=Enter a location with peaks that touch the sky
research.m_DESERT.text=Find a sun-scorned place
research.m_FOREST.text=Explore a dense, leafy area
thaumicaugmentation.research.arcane_terraformer.1=The true scale of the natural and supernatural world is still as unclear as ever, but despite that I have gained brief glimpses and flashes of understanding that have taught me how I can change it far more than I could before. In front of me I have a set of designs that detail a device that uses the combined power of the aura, the elements, and the Void to terraform the world around it, changing biomes precisely how I instruct it to. Appropriately, I have named this device the Arcane Terraformer.<BR>The Terraformer itself is all packed into a single contraption, but it requires a great deal of additional equipment and setup in order to function. I will cover the device in detail for my future reference; it is a very complex piece of arcane engineering, and it is far too easy for me to forget the specifics of its functionality.<BR>The first step to bending the world to my will is to configure the specific biome that the Arcane Terraformer will convert the area around it into. I have created a special Biome Focus to serve this purpose. To attune the focus to a biome, I simply need to visit the biome in question and use the Focus within it. This will store the intrinsic properties of the biome in the Focus, a sort of "fingerprint", which will later allow the Arcane Terraformer to perfectly replicate it. Sneaking while using the focus will clear its current biome, allowing it to be reused.<BR>I have already considered a potential dilemma I may face after terraforming: what if I want to restore the land to its original state? To save myself the headache of manually managing Biome Foci, I have found a way to allow the Terraformer to perfectly restore the original biome or biomes in its area of operation. I refer to this as the primeval state, as it is the way the land was originally formed. At least, original enough for my purposes. To create a primeval Biome Focus, I only need to place the Focus with a primordial pearl in a crafting grid. This does not consume any portion of the pearl, since the Focus only absorbs the pearl's ambient energy.<BR>The first step in actually using the Terraformer is to access its configuration panel by using the device after placing it in the world. At the center of the panel is where I place the configured Biome Focus, which gets affixed to the top of the device. On the right are the area settings, which allow me to specifiy both the size and shape of the terraforming area. The left side will display the amount of essentia I need to fully terraform the entire selected area, assuming I have a Biome Focus inserted into the Terraformer.<BR>I then need to ensure that the Arcane Terraformer has access to sufficient amounts of three resources: vis, essentia, and impetus. Vis is simple enough, as the Terraformer will simply draw a small amount of Vis from the area it is placed in for each square metre of the world it converts. Impetus is slightly more complicated, as I must connect a charged impetus input into the central jewel at the bottom of the device.<BR>The last ingredient is essentia, and a lot of it. There are five types of essentia that the Arcane Terraformer could potentially need to terraform the area. These are Ignis, Aqua, Aer, Terra, and Permutatio. The first four are the primal elemental aspects, and these will be required if they are a part of the biome that is to be terraformed into. Fiery or hot biomes will need ignis, damp biomes require aqua, and so on. Some biomes may not need a certain elemental aspect of essentia at all. However, every biome requires Permutatio in some capacity - this is what allows the Terraformer to actually exchange the biomes. The exact amount of essentia required increases with the amount of area that needs to be terraformed, which can be seen on the left side of the information panel as previously mentioned. This is probably one of the most essentia-hungry devices I have designed to date, since it requires so much to permanently change the physical world. If I plan on using this device frequently or over a large area, I should prepare plenty of essentia jars filled with the four elemental aspects and permutatio.<BR>With all of this setup done, I will be able to finally start the terraforming process by using a casting gauntlet on the Arcane Terraformer. If I need to cancel it for any reason, I can use a gauntlet on it a second time, although any terraforming that was already done will not revert.<BR>Despite the high resource cost the device needs to terraform an area, there is a major benefit I can gain from selecting certain biomes: I can increase the vis cap of the local aura. As part of the terraforming process, the Arcane Terraformer restabilizes the aura in any area it has terraformed. When transforming biomes with little vis to more magically attuned biomes, such as magical forests, the maximum vis that the area can hold will be dramatically increased. This can be especially helpful should my base of operations be located in an area with lower amounts of natural vis. However, the aura can also have its cap be lowered in this way, so I need to monitor the aura in areas I have terraformed, lest I unexpectedly run out of vis.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_feeder.title=Feeding Rifts
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_feeder.0=Flux rifts can grow to some fairly large sizes simply by absorbing flux from the local aura, but they can only do so to a certain limit. At some point, it grows large enough where it cannot absorb flux efficiently enough to grow any further. This can present a problem in that if I am draining a rift for one reason or another, I need to constantly monitor its size to ensure I do not drain it out of existence. Furthermore, I would rather not have to repeatedly pollute the aura in order to keep the rift at a decent size, as the flux can spread to other areas and generally cause a mess.<BR>There has to be a better way to grow my flux rifts. After some thinking, I believe there might be a solution to this problem. In my previous efforts around flux management, I managed to create the Flux Condenser, which draws flux from the aura and condenses it into Vitium essentia. I do not see a reason why I would not be able to do the opposite.<BR>It is already technically possible to do such a thing, in that I can simply place a jar of essentia and empty it into the aura as flux, but this is not what I need. Instead, I will need to transfer the flux carefully by focusing it all into a specific point, which in this case would be a flux rift. I will need to be careful with my experimentation here, as flux has a habit of being very insidious in how it pollutes an area. The last thing I need is an infestation of taint eating away at my base of operations...
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_feeder.1=I can now breathe a sigh of relief, as I have managed to successfully avoid creating a major flux problem, at least with this particular batch of research. I'd rather not think about the problems I may have already caused. Ahem.<BR>Regardless, I have managed to reengineer my design for the Flux Condenser into a device I am calling the Flux Inducer. While its name might suggest that it creates flux in the area around it, this is not quite the truth, as the whole point of making this device is to avoid doing that. Rather, when pointed at a flux rift, the Inducer will be able to feed flux directly into it, causing the rift to grow. Because this directly inserts flux into the rift, instead of relying on it to absorb flux on its own, rifts should be able to grow far larger than they would normally be able to. My calculations suggest that they can grow twice as large as before, so I should ensure there is enough space for these massive rifts to grow without breaking vital equipment.<BR>However, nothing in this world ever seems to come without a price, and as such the Flux Inducer has some caveats to its operation. First and foremost, it needs Vitium essentia in order to grow a rift. It can be fed into any side of the device except its front, via the usual piping mechanisms. It can require a lot of Vitium to grow the rift, and the amount required gradually increases as the rift's size increases, so a steady supply of Vitium is a must. The original Flux Condenser would probably pair very well with the Flux Inducer for this purpose.<BR>Secondly, I need to ensure the device is placed facing the rift, as the front of the device contains the rift feeding mechanism. I can place the device facing me by simply placing it as normal, but if I sneak while placing it the Flux Inducer will be facing away from me. I will also need to ensure that the Inducer is kept within about 12 metres of the rift, and the rift is placed in view of the Inducer. I will know when the device is in range when faint, flux-colored particles are being pulled from the Flux Inducer by the rift. This does not actually consume any Vitium essentia, nor does it affect the state of the rift in any discernable way.<BR>Thirdly, an important point to mention is that feeding a rift in this way will cause it to grow unstable. This is probably a side effect of inserting the flux into the rift, rather than letting the rift absorb flux at its own pace. I may wish to use one of the methods of stabilizing rifts I have researched, keeping in mind any byproducts (like flux) they produce.<BR>Finally, I can deactivate the Flux Inducer with a redstone signal. If the front nozzle of the Inducer is a bright purple, than it is active.

thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_generator.title=Impetus Generator
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_generator.0=Mundane electrical energy is something I have already managed to generate through thaumaturgic means, despite how the two disciplines tend to work against each other. But while the Vis Generator is quite effective, it is still limited in how much RF/FE it can output, due to the fact that the linking mechanism limits the conversion rate, and trying to go beyond this limit would most likely result in the magical and mundane energies making contact, creating all manner of havoc.<BR>However, I need not be limited by vis anymore, as my recent discovery of charged impetus provides me with an alternative method of generating kinetic energy which can then be used to power an electrical generator. From some cursory investigation, impetus interacts with mundane power differently than vis does. Its unpredictable and volatile nature ironically means that it isn’t so strongly affected by it, as it can adapt itself to become resistant to mundane power’s negative influence, so I should be able to use it to generate electricity faster than I can with vis.<BR>This new generator shouldn’t be too hard to prototype since I already have the framework designed with the Vis Generator. If I swap out the appropriate vis and aura-related components with Void and impetus-centric ones, and modify the underlying linkages and energy containment systems to account for the more unpredictable forces of the Void, I should be able to feed these into the same axle and electrical generator that I used for the Vis Generator.
thaumicaugmentation.research.impetus_generator.1=After some further study of impetus power and reworking of the designs for the Vis Generator, I now have access to a new RF/FE generating device which uses the powers of the Void in its operation as opposed to the vis I have been using previously. It takes a few more advanced components to create and requires charged impetus in order to run, but it can generate electrical power at a far better rate than the Vis Generator.<BR>Once built, the Impetus Generator is used in a very similar way to the Vis Generator. Firstly, it must be directly attached to an appropriate redstone flux or forge energy using, transferring, or storing block. Secondly, a beam of charged impetus energy must be linked into it using the Impetus Resonator to do so. Then, once the Impetus Generator receives charged impetus power, it will generate 1500 RF/FE for a small amount of impetus, of which it can output 50 RF/FE per tick. The output speed, while still limited, is much better than the Vis Generator’s, so if I have any magical devices that need mundane energy to run (or if I am dabbling in the use of mundane technology and feel like using more esoteric means of generating power) then this can act as an excellent source of it.<BR>As with most of my devices, the generator can be turned off with a redstone signal.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_moving.title=Rift Relocation
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_moving.0=The fabric of reality does seem to be a very fickle thing, and one may find evidence for this in how flux rifts appear.<BR>When an area gains too much flux, a rift appears, this is well documented. However, where the rift appears is an inexact science. They generally appear on the surface, or at the highest point where there is solid ground. But even with that in mind, where they precisely appear is almost impossible to predict. I would rather not have to work around this behaviour, instead, I would prefer to have the option to move the rift to wherever I choose.<BR>Moving something that extends into higher dimensions will not be an easy feat to undertake, however. While I could hypothetically ‘drag’ the rift to a particular spot, I imagine this could have some particularly destructive effects on the fabric of reality, so I will have to be a little more creative in how I move them.<BR>Warded jars are specially designed to contain dangerous substances, primarily essentia. However, with some additional modifications I might be able to have them hold a small pocket of space within them, that space including a rift breaking through it. This would therefore prevent any negative effects that simply moving the rift around would have, since it would all be contained safely within the jar.<BR>While this is all good in theory, I still haven’t found a way to actually do this, and I haven’t thought of a way to get a rift into a jar in the first place. One might think this is a major setback and that it might as well be impossible, but as a Thaumaturge I do the impossible on a regular basis. Magic is a very powerful thing, after all.
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_moving.1=I have spent a great deal of effort further analyzing the dimensional magic that flux rifts are a product of, and as a result of that effort I have now designed a method for moving them from one place to another. The process requires some very specialized equipment, which is unsurprising given what I am working with.<BR>There are a total of three things I will need to move a rift from one place to another: a special type of warded jar to contain the rift; a device that can pull the rift inside itself and place it within the jar; and a device that can take the rift out of the jar and project it back out into the world. I shall cover each one in turn.<BR>Firstly, the jar. I have designed this jar to be far sturdier than a normal jar, in order to contain a volatile rift and the space in which it inhabits. To that end, it contains additional protective glyphs, an additional warding sigil and a set of sturdy magically resistant metal braces, all to prevent the rift from breaking loose. It cannot be used to store essentia anymore, but this hardly matters since it wouldn’t have any particular benefit for that purpose over an ordinary warded jar.<BR>Secondly, the device that places the rift into a jar, which I am calling the Metaspatial Accumulator. It is a complex device able to carefully manipulate space in dimensions beyond the ordinary three, so it would be wise to make sure that I do not lose it once I have it. To use it, I only need to place it beneath a flux rift (making sure that the rift does not destroy it in the process), place a reinforced jar directly below the device (if I can see the device connected to the jar then I have set it up correctly), and then to actually store the rift in the jar I use the Accumulator with a caster’s gauntlet.<BR>This jarring process can take some time depending on how big the rift is, and as it is being jarred the rift will lose stability, but if the process is successful then the rift will vanish and be placed within the jar. It would be wise to stand back when the rift vanishes though, as when a rift closes or collapses it creates a sudden shift in reality that is quite unpleasant to the psyche of nearby people who experience it (and I’d rather not think too hard about the damage already done to my mind).<BR>However, the jarring process can fail in a few different ways. Firstly, if the rift is so unstable that it tries to collapse, then the rift will ‘snap back’ to its original size and become extremely unstable, stopping the Accumulator in the process. It will fail in a similar way if I deliberately try to collapse the rift with a causality collapser. In some cases, instead of “snapping back” to its full size, it will instead release a large amount of flux. This seems to occur when the rift would disappear in a manner other than collapsing, such as when a taint seed is produced. The Metaspatial Accumulator will also fail if it or the Reinforced jar is broken. I should also note that if there is still a lot of flux in the area when the rift is successfully jarred, then another rift may appear immediately afterward, so I should be prepared for that.<BR>Thirdly, getting the rift out of the jar. To do that, I will need a third device I have named the Metaspatial Extruder. The unjarring process is very similar to the jarring one, so I must first place the Extruder down, and place a jarred rift directly underneath it. If I am wearing Goggles of Revealing, I can see an estimation of where the rift will be placed above the device. To begin, I simply need to use a caster’s gauntlet on the device. The rift will then gradually begin to appear above the device, and if the process is successful then the rift will fully form, emptying the connected jar. If the Extruder tries to place the rift close to a rift that is already present, then the device will not start the process as a safety measure, as that could get very dangerous. If the process is interrupted by the rift collapsing or the device/jar being broken, then the rift will dissipate entirely, leaving nothing more than a large cloud of flux behind, which might form a new rift in the process.<BR>There are risks involved with all of this, there is no doubt, but I cannot turn back now, and if the worst that can happen with either machine is that another flux rift is created, then so be it. After all, I can just use that flux rift instead.<BR>Finally, of note is that I can keep rifts inside reinforced jars indefinitely, so they can work well for decorative purposes, since they are safe if not disturbed. The rift will break free chaotically if the jar is destroyed in something like lava or fire however, which will create a lot of flux, cause the rift to become very unstable while also destroying the jar completely, so if I want to get the rift out then using the Metaspatial Extruder is the better thing to do. I am unsure what will happen if I try to destroy a jarred rift in a more unique way, such as with purely technological systems designed to store and catalogue items, so I should be prepared for the worst if I decide to study disciplines outside of Thaumaturgy and use them to destroy a jarred rift.<BR>Interestingly, a jarred rift can even be used as a means of item destruction in itself. If a device such as a hopper or golem is used to place items in it, then those items will be completely destroyed. The rift will become a little unstable as it does so, but since it is contained it will regain its stability soon after. This does leave me with a dark thought, however: what if I were to jar two rifts, and then try and destroy one jarred rift by placing it in the other, or if I were to throw one jarred rift into a rift present in the world? If I am not fully prepared to find out the answer to this conundrum, then playing it safe may be for the best...

thaumicaugmentation.research.stability_field_generator.title=Advanced Stabilization Methods
thaumicaugmentation.research.stability_field_generator.0=Dangerous magic is often naturally unstable, as chaotic magical energies are created that need to be released in one form or another, this form generally being very unpleasant for any Thaumaturge who happens to be nearby. Thus, on behalf of all Thaumaturges, I have decided to find a better way to deal with unstable magic, in this case unstable magic made by flux rifts.<BR>I have already designed a device that can stabilize flux rifts, the stabilizer, but as it was originally designed to stabilize arcane infusions it is not very effective at dealing with the more distributed form of instability that a rift creates. It works very slowly if I am only using a few, I cannot turn it off when I need to, and it creates a lot of flux that can actually make a flux rift grow even worse. It is a little bit like using a bucket of lava to put out a house fire: yes, the lava may smother some of the flames, but the lava itself is creating even more fire which spreads everywhere, and suddenly I am left without a house, the house being analogous for a stable aura I suppose.<BR>Regardless, I know I can do better than this. The Stabilizer’s ability to stabilize flux rifts is only a side effect created by how it works, so if I instead try to create a stabilizing device designed to work on flux rifts specifically, then I should be much more successful than before.<BR>Previously, I used a limited amount of mundane technology in the form of a redstone block to stabilize infusions, so I am now wondering if I can use mundane technology in a slightly more advanced fashion to get a better result. I have already managed to generate mundane electrical power in the form of RF/FE with the vis generator, so perhaps I should try to study ordinary electricity a little further? Simply bombarding a flux rift with electricity won’t work, however, so I’ll need to be intelligent with how I apply it.
thaumicaugmentation.research.stability_field_generator.1=Mundane technology has once again provided me with the answer to my stability problems. Previously I had trouble properly understanding the links between electrical power and magical power, but after some careful study I now understand a little better how the two may interact with one another. Generally this means rather poorly, but if I am careful I should be able to use one to neutralize or otherwise restrict the other. In this case, I can use electricity in the form of redstone flux or forge energy to quell unstable rift energies.<BR>To facilitate this interaction, I have taken my design for the infusion stabilizer and heavily reworked it, so much so that my new design only vaguely resembles the old one. I am calling this new design the Stability Field Generator. It uses a few different magical and technological principles in order to operate. By taking RF or FE, sending it through some additional redstone circuits and stabilizing runes and then discharging it through an amber tip, it fires a beam which creates a containment field of sorts. The amber is a key component here; by applying sympathetic magic, I can use it to ‘trap’ a flux rift in a field of stabilizing energy, which will cause it to rapidly regain stability without the flux problem that a normal stabilizer creates.<BR>To use the device, I first need to point it so that its tip faces a flux rift. Then, I need to feed in mundane RF/FE into any side of the device except its front, since the front is where the field is emitted from. I may want to use vis generators for this, as they are very compact and can feed their power directly into a port on the Stability Field Generator. Once it receives power, the front of the device will open, and it will fire the stability field directly at the rift. It uses 100 RF/FE every second while active, which is not exactly cheap, but I have built the device so that it can be turned off by applying a redstone signal to it. The more Stability Field Generators I use on a rift, the faster it will regain stability.<BR>One major drawback that the device has is that when it is left on for extended periods of time, the stabilizing field will gradually begin to lose effectiveness as the internal mechanics begin to overheat. However, if the device is turned off, it will cool down over a period of time and eventually fully recover. I can tell how overheated a Stability Field Generator is based on two visual cues. The first is the transparency of the beam it produces, with a less opaque beam being less efficient. The other sign is the presence of electricity discharging across it, visible as red electrical arcs on and around the device. Given that it will consume the same amount of energy but mitigate much less instability while overheated, it would be wise to make sure that I turn off any Stability Field Generators when I do not need them. Hypothetically speaking, it should be reasonable for me to automate such a process.<BR>While I can readily use my Thaumaturgy-specific means of generating electricity for the device to use, it will accept power from anywhere else as long as that power is in the form of RF or FE. Thus, if I have access to more advanced technological systems that can generate that form of electricity, or even alternate magical disciplines that interact with mundane energy, then I can use any power generators provided by them in order to power the stability field.<BR>I should note that since this device is designed to work on the more distributed form of instability that a flux rift creates, it will not be able to stabilize infusions. A pity, but it would be difficult to redesign the device a second time to work like that, and I already have the infusion stabilizer for that purpose anyway.

thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_monitor.title=Monitoring Dimensional Effects
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_monitor.0=While I can learn a fair amount about a flux rift just by simple observation, I can only understand so much with the naked eye alone. I need a better way to study them, which I believe will require a new, specialized device.<BR>Previously I have created the Thaumic Dioptra, which uses a Thaumometer to analyze the aura in a wide radius before displaying the strengths of vis and flux as a heightmap. I believe I can rework this design, but instead make the Thaumometer at its core receptive to the energies produced by flux rifts. I could use the readings created by this device for a few different purposes, so I am sure the final product will be well worth the research.<BR>I simply must try to learn more about extra-dimensional phenomenon. Despite the risks involved, it is all so very fascinating...
thaumicaugmentation.research.rift_monitor.1=Interesting... so very interesting... this has all been something of a learning exercise, and I now know quite a bit more about flux rifts than I did before. This knowledge will be absolutely invaluable for my future studies into dimensional magic, in fact these studies have already borne fruit in a new device I have designed, which I am calling the Extradimensional Monitor.<BR>The device contains a heavily modified Thaumometer at its core, with specially selected runes designed to make it sensitive to the energies produced by phenomena that breach into higher dimensional space. There are quite a few things that create these energies, however, so I have made sure that it only responds to the particular signature that a flux rift creates, otherwise things like Nether or End portals could interfere with the device and produce false readings.<BR>Once placed down, the Monitor scans the local area and once it picks up something it recognizes, it will begin collecting data about it, projecting that data on the display above. In the case of flux rifts, the device will display a hologram of the rift it is monitoring. It has a fairly large radius in which it can pick up rifts, but I should note that if a monitor is placed down and the rift changes size, this may cause the rift to go outside the range of the monitor and therefore it will lose track of it, so if I am monitoring a rift that changes size frequently then I should try to keep the monitor fairly close by.<BR>The device has two modes that I can switch between by right-clicking the device, these modes being for size and stability. Size mode analyses how large a flux rift is. The grid below has a pair of markers that show how tall a two block stack is in comparison to the size of the flux rift, so I can use that to tell roughly how big the rift is compared to myself. Stability mode is designed to monitor the rift’s stability, unsurprisingly. The view is pulled in closer to a cross-section of the rift hologram, and from there I can observe how much the rift is shaking to better see how unstable it is. As I have noted before, a perfectly stable rift will be perfectly still, and a very unstable one will thrash about violently.<BR>Another feature the device has, one that may prove to be particularly useful, is its ability to create a redstone signal. By connecting a redstone comparator to the side of the monitor, the comparator will output a redstone signal that correlates to the current size or stability of the rift it is analyzing, depending on what mode the monitor is set to. For instance, if the monitor is set to size mode, then the comparator signal will become stronger the larger the rift is, and if it is set to stability mode, the comparator signal will get stronger the more stable the rift is. I can see potential future use in automatic rift management systems with this feature, like ensuring that a void siphon draining the rift is turned off if the rift gets too small or unstable.<BR>As the dimensional fractures I have discovered are a naturally appearing variant of flux rifts that create a bridge across dimensions, the Extradimensional Monitor can very easily be tuned to analyze them. As with flux rifts, the device has two modes for fracture reading.<BR>Mode one reads the fracture and shows some details about where it leads to. A 7 by 7 grid is displayed beneath the fracture, with this showing the ambient colours of the biome that it leads to. The potential grass colour of the biome is displayed in the 3x3 centre of the grid, the potential foliage colour is displayed in the hollow 5x5 grid around that, and the water colour is displayed in the hollow 7x7 grid around that. This is somewhat limited, but I can gain some insight about the destination, with greener colours of grass and foliage leading to more lush areas, yellower colours of grass leading to arid areas like deserts, darker coloured water likely leading to swamp-like areas, so on and so forth. Different dimensions are also indicated this way, so to better differentiate them from biomes in the Overworld.<BR>Mode two pulls the view in closer to the fracture, but unlike with rifts it does not monitor stability, since fractures do not get unstable. Instead, it just provides a closer look, which I can use to see if the fracture is open or closed.<BR>I am learning so much about dimensional tears as of late, and I can sense such potential lurking here. For now, I can only imagine what I might be able to create with all of this knowledge in the future.

thaumicaugmentation.research.primordial_wisp.title=Primordial Wisp
thaumicaugmentation.research.primordial_wisp.0=Whatever I was expecting to be created as the result of a flux rift being destroyed by another flux rift, I cannot say that it was this. Apparently the combination of two chaotic tears in reality creates life, or at least something resembling it, and this life does not seem to appreciate my part in its creation.<BR>I have seen wisps before, but none as powerful as this one. Unlike the single dimensional core that a normal wisp has, this one seems to be made up of multiple dimensional singularities closely orbiting one another, with each one being attuned to a different primal energy. It attacks like a normal wisp, but unlike a normal wisp it is always hostile to me, and it can take far more damage before eventually being destroyed too.<BR>It also seems to react to its surroundings, drawing energy from both the aura and the matter around it. This leads me to believe that its abilities may be slightly different, depending on what materials it has available to it.<BR>Despite how unexpected and how dangerous this discovery is, it may still be of use to me. If I am prepared then I should try and kill this powerful wisp, as I believe the fading dimensional energies may congeal into something far more valuable than the simple vis crystal that an ordinary wisp creates.

thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_battery_augment.title=Gauntlet Vis Storage
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_battery_augment.0=I have made great strides in the efficacy of my casting, allowing me access to more powerful, rapid, or efficient spellcasting. Even with all of these improvements, however, there is still one major issue with relying on foci: in the absence of a suitably strong Aura, I am left being unable to use any of my focus effects, no matter how much gauntlet augmentation I have done.<BR>That being said, repurposing my older creations has been the solution to many Thaumaturgical problems, and I believe this is no exception. Vis Batteries do almost exactly what I need; they absorb Vis when it is plentiful, and release it if the Aura is depleted. The only challenge will be somehow limiting the Vis Batteries to only potentially release vis when casting, but I have always found ways around these dilemmas in the past, and do not intend to let this break that trend.
thaumicaugmentation.research.vis_battery_augment.1=Although it does not feel like it, I have made another great stride in my studies of Auromancy. My invention of portable Vis Batteries in augment form has eliminated one of its major weaknesses.<BR>The Vis Battery augment works similarly to a normal Vis Battery. It can only charge itself with Vis by direct exposure to the Aura, not through any other method. It will also only take in Vis when the Aura is at least 90% saturated with vis. Unlike Vis Batteries, the augment will not automatically discharge when in a weak Aura. Instead, it will discharge Vis if the focus I am attempting to cast requires more Vis than is available in the Aura. This means I cannot use it as a true portable Vis battery, as I cannot arbitrarily decide to release the stored Vis into the Aura, but this was never the goal to begin with.<BR>While I have successfully linked four Vis Batteries in series in the final augment, the total vis capacity is still somewhat low. I may want to combine this augment with others that reduce the total casting cost if I frequently find myself drawing from the very limited pool of stored vis.
